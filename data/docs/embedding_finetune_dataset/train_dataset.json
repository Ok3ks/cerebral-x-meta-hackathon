This absorption of photons generates an electric current as the electrons\nwithin the material gain energy and start to \u0000ow. This current is then captured and sent through an\ninverter, which converts the direct current (DC) into alternating current (AC) electricity, suitable for\nuse in homes and buildings.\nA solar energy system consists of several key components that work together to harness and\nconvert solar energy into usable electricity. Let\u2019s take a closer look at each of these components:\n1. Solar Panels: Solar panels, also known as photovoltaic modules, are the most recognizable\ncomponent of a solar energy system. These panels are made up of multiple solar cells connected in\nseries or parallel to generate the desired voltage and current output.\n2. Mounting System: The mounting system provides the structural support for solar panels and ensures\nthey are securely installed on rooftops or ground-mounted structures.

Inverter: The inverter is a vital component that converts the DC electricity generated by the solar\npanels into AC electricity, which can be used to power electrical appliances and be fed into the\nelectrical grid.\n4. Battery Storage (Optional): Battery storage systems allow excess electricity generated by solar\npanels to be stored for later use. Batteries are particularly useful in areas with unreliable grid\nconnections or for those seeking energy independence.\n5.

Based on its 100% Renewable Europe \nstudy, SolarPower Europe calculates that an additional 870 GW of solar PV installations will be required for the \nEU to meet its 2030 emissions commitments. This rapid growth makes it even more important to ensure that \nindustry best practices are harmonised, allowing O&M service providers to scale up their operations while  \nmaintaining quality standards. \nThese guidelines take a more integrated approach to occupational health & safety by combining them with  \nsecurity and environmental protection in a revamped Health, Safety, Security, and Environment chapter. The \nInnovations and trends chapter has been updated to include innovative new field inspection techniques, such \nas drone-based UV Fluorescence imaging. Furthermore, the increasing popularity of commercial & industrial,  \nand residential rooftop PV installations has led to an overhaul of the O&M for rooftop solar chapter to separate \nthese two segments and provide more specialised recommendations. Finally, this fifth edition has seen the  \nDefinitions chapter move to the new Lifecycle Quality Guidelines, reflecting the overall importance of a shared \nlanguage between the stakeholders of a solar PV project. \nThis document is the first O&M Best Practice Guidelines produced by the newly rebranded Lifecycle Quality  \nWorkstream. It builds on 2019\u2019s fourth edition and is the result of a year of intensive work by 29 leading solar  \nexperts, from 20 companies. The contributors work across the solar PV industry and include O&M service  \nproviders, Asset Managers, Asset Owners, renewable energy consultants, legal experts, digital solutions providers, \nand technical advisors. \nThe Workstream has been busy in 2021, updating the EPC and O&M Best Practice Guidelines and writing the  \nnew Lifecycle Quality Guidelines. Members have also been involved in several international projects, including \ncooperating with the South African PV Industry Association (SAPVIA) to produce the South African edition of  \nthe O&M Best Practice Guidelines (launched in October 2021). The Workstream has also launched projects to  \ncreate the Indian and Sub-Saharan African editions of the EPC Best Practice Guidelines and will be working to  \ncomplete these and a new Jordanian edition of the O&M Best Practice Guidelines.  \nWe thank our members for their extraordinary level of engagement, which reflects the importance of lifecycle \nquality for our sector. We will continue the work in 2022 and invite interested stakeholders to join our  \nWorkstream activities and help us further improve our contribution to the solar PV industry. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nADELE ARA  \nHead of Global Business  \nOperations, Lightsource bp \nChair of the SolarPower Europe \nLifecycle Quality Workstream\nWALBURGA \nHEMETSBERGER  \nChief Executive Officer,  \nSolarPower Europe",

In many \nsituations, solar power plants offer an opportunity to  \nsupport agriculture and are a valuable natural habitat  \nfor plants and animals alongside the primary purpose \nof power production. \n \nPersonnel & training \nIt is important that all O&M personnel have the  \nrelevant experience and qualifications to perform  \nwork in a safe, responsible, and accountable manner.  \nThese Guidelines contain a skills\u2019 matrix template that \nhelps to record skills and identify gaps. \n \nTechnical asset management \nTechnical Asset Management (TAM) encompasses  \nsupport activities to ensure the best operation of a  \nsolar power plant or a portfolio, i.e., to maximise energy \nproduction, minimise downtime and reduce costs. In  \nmany cases, the O&M service provider assumes some \nTAM tasks such as planning and reporting on Key  \nPerformance Indicators (KPIs) to the Asset Owner.  \nHowever, in cases where the Technical Asset Manager \nand the O&M service provider are separate entities,  \nclose coordination and information sharing between  \nthe two entities is indispensable. TAM also includes  \nensuring that the operation of the solar PV power plant \ncomplies with national and local regulations and  \ncontracts, and advising the Asset Owner on technical \nasset optimisation via repowering investments, for  \nexample. For more information about AM, please refer \nto SolarPower Europe\u2019s Asset Management Best  \nPractice Guidelines, which can be downloaded from  \nwww.solarpowereurope.org. \n \nPower plant operation \nOperation is about remote monitoring, supervision,  \nand control of the solar PV power plant  and it is an  \nincreasingly active exercise as grid operators require  \nincreasing flexibility from solar power plants. Power  \nplant operation also involves liaising with or  \ncoordination of the maintenance team. A proper solar \nPV power plant documentation management system \nis crucial for Operations. A list of documents that  \nshould be included in the as-built documentation set  \nExecutive summary\nOperation and Maintenance (O&M) has become a  \nstandalone segment within the solar industry, and it is \nwidely acknowledged by all stakeholders that high-\nquality O&M services mitigate potential risks, improve \nthe Levelised Cost of Electricity (LCOE) and Power  \nPurchase Agreement (PPA) prices, and positively  \nimpact the return on investment (ROI). Responding to \nthe discrepancies that exist in today\u2019s solar O&M  \nmarket, the SolarPower Europe O&M Best Practice  \nGuidelines make it possible for all to benefit from the \nexperience of leading experts in the sector and  \nincrease the level of quality and consistency in O&M.  \nThese Guidelines are meant for O&M service  \nproviders, investors, financiers, Asset Owners, Asset  \nManagers, monitoring tool providers, technical  \nconsultants, and all interested stakeholders in Europe \nand beyond. \nIn this edition of the O&M Best practice Guidelines, the \nDefinitions and Stakeholders sections have been  \nmoved to the new Lifecycle Quality Guidelines. This has \nbeen done to reflect the importance of having a  \ncommon understanding of the roles and  \nresponsibilities, and core workloads of each stakeholder \nin a solar PV project. This document then walks the  \nreader through the different components of O&M,  \nclassifying requirements into \u201cminimum requirements\u201d, \n\u201cbest practices\u201d and \u201crecommendations\u201d. \n \nHealth, Safety, Security, and Environment (HSSE) \nSolar PV power plants are electricity generating power \nstations and have significant hazards present which  \ncan result in injury or death. Risks should be reduced  \nthrough proper hazard identification, careful planning \nof works, briefing of procedures to be followed, regular \ndocumented inspection, and maintenance. Specific  \ntraining, certification, and personal protective  \nequipment are required for several tasks. Almost all  \njobs have some safety requirements such as fall  \nprotection for work at heights and electrical arc-flash, \nlock-out tag-out, and general electrical safety for  \nelectrical work, eye, and ear protection for ground  \nmaintenance. Power plant  security systems should  \nform an integrated part of health & safety (H&S) by  \nensuring that trespassers or members of the public do \nnot gain access to the plant or its hazardous areas.  \nEnvironmental problems are normally avoidable  \nthrough proper plant design and maintenance, but  \nwhere issues do occur, the O&M service provider must \ndetect them and respond promptly.

Based on the data and \nanalyses gained through monitoring and supervision,  \nthe O&M service provider should always strive to  \nimprove solar PV power plant performance. As there  \nare strict legal requiremen ts for security services in  \nmost countries, solar PV power plant security should \nbe ensured by specialised security service providers.  \n \nPower plant maintenance \nMaintenance is usually carried out on-site by  \nspecialised technicians or subcontractors, according \nto the Operations team\u2019s analyses. A core element of \nmaintenance services, Preventive Maintenance  \ninvolves regular visual and physical inspections,  \nfunctional testing, and measurements, as well as the  \nverification activities necessary to comply with the  \noperating manuals and warranty requirements. The  \nAnnual Maintenance Plan (see an example in Annex e) \nincludes a list of inspections and actions that should  \nbe performed regularly. Corrective Maintenance  \ncovers activities aimed at restoring a faulty solar PV  \npower plant , equipment or component to a status  \nwhere it can perform the required function.  \nExtraordinary Maintenance actions, usually not  \ncovered by the O&M fixed fee, can be necessary after \nmajor unpredictable events in the plant site that  \nrequire substantial repair works. Additional  \nmaintenance services may include tasks such as  \nmodule cleaning and vegetation control, which could \nbe done by the O&M service provider or outsourced to \nspecialist providers. \n \nRevamping and repowering \nRevamping and repowering are usually considered a  \npart of extraordinary maintenance from a contractual \npoint of view \u2013 however, due to their increasing  \nsignificance in the solar O&M market, these Guidelines \naddress them in a standalone chapter. Revamping and \nrepowering are defined as the replacement of old,  \npower production related components within a power \nplant by new components to enhance the overall  \nperformance of the installation. This chapter presents \nbest practices in module and inverter revamping and  \nrepowering and general, commercial considerations to \nkeep in mind before implementation.\nSpare parts management \nSpare Parts Management is an inherent and  \nsubstantial part of O&M aimed at ensuring that spare \nparts are available in a timely manner for Preventive  \nand Corrective Maintenance to minimise the  \ndowntime of a solar PV power plant. As best practice, \nthe spare parts should be owned by the Asset Owner  \nwhile normally maintenance, storage and  \nreplenishment should be the responsibility of the  \nO&M service provider. It is considered a best practice \nnot to include the cost of replenishment of spare  \nparts in the O&M fixed fee. However, if the Asset  \nOwner requires the O&M service provider to bear  \nreplenishment costs, the more cost-effective  \napproach is to agree which are \"Included Spare Parts\" \nand which are \"Excluded Spare Parts\". These  \nGuidelines also include a minimum list of spare parts  \nthat are considered essential.  \n \nData and monitoring requirements \nThe purpose of the monitoring system is to allow  \nsupervision of the performance of a solar PV power \nplant. Requirements for effective monitoring include  \ndataloggers capable of collecting data (such as energy \ngenerated, irradiance, module temperature, etc.) of all \nrelevant components (such as inverters, energy  \nmeters, pyranometers, temperature sensors) and  \nstoring at least one month of data with a recording  \ngranularity of up to 15 minutes, as well as a reliable  \nMonitoring Portal (interface) for the visualisation of the \ncollected data and the calculation of KPIs. Monitoring \nis increasingly employing satellite data as a source of \nsolar resource data to be used as a comparison for on-\nsite pyranometers. As best practice, the monitoring  \nsystem should ensure open data accessibility to  \nenable an easy transition between monitoring  \nplatforms and interoperability of different applications. \nAs remotely monitored and controlled systems, solar \nPV power plants are exposed to cybersecurity risks. It \nis therefore vital that installations undertake a  \ncybersecurity analysis and implement a cybersecurity \nmanagement system. To evaluate monitoring tools, it \nis recommended to refer to the Monitoring Checklist  \nof the Solar Best Practices Mark, which is available at  \nwww.solarbestpractices.com.\nExecutive summary  /  continued",

Solar PV power plant  KPIs  \ninclude important indicators such as the Performance \nRatio (PR), which is the energy generated divided by  \nthe energy obtainable under ideal conditions  \nexpressed as a percentage, and Uptime (or Technical  \nAvailability) which are parameters that represent, as a \npercentage, the time during which the plant operates \nover the total possible time it is able to operate. O&M  \nservice provider KPIs include Acknowledgement Time \n(the time between the alarm and the  \nacknowledgement), Intervention Time (the time  \nbetween acknowledgement and reaching the plant by \na technician) and Resolution Time (the time to resolve \nthe fault starting from the moment of reaching the  \nsolar PV power plant ). Acknowledgement Time plus  \nIntervention Time are called Response Time, an  \nindicator used for contractual guarantees. The most  \nimportant KPI which reflects solar PV power plant  \nperformance and O&M service quality at the same  \ntime is the Contractual Availability. While Uptime (or  \nTechnical Availability) reflects all downtimes  \nregardless of the cause, Contractual Availability  \ninvolves certain exclusion factors to account for  \ndowntimes not attributable to the O&M service  \nprovider (such as force majeure), a difference  \nimportant for contractual purposes. \n \nContractual framework \nAlthough some O&M service providers still provide  \nPerformance Ratio guarantees, it is best practice to  \nonly use Availability and Response Time guarantees,  \nwhich has several advantages. A best practice is a  \nminimum guaranteed Availability of 98% over a year,  \nwith Contractual Availability guarantees translated  \ninto Bonus Schemes and Liquidated Damages. When  \nsetting Response Time guarantees, it is recommended \nto differentiate between hours and periods with high  \nand low irradiance levels as well as fault classes, i.e.,  \nthe (potential) power loss. As a best practice, we  \nrecommend using the O&M template contract  \ndeveloped as part of the Open Solar Contracts, a joint \ninitiative of the Terrawatt Initiative and the  \nInternational Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). The  \nOpen Solar Contracts are available at  \nwww.opensolarcontracts.org. \n \nInnovations and trends \nO&M service providers are increasingly relying on  \ninnovations and more machine and data-driven  \nsolutions to keep up with market requirements. The  \nmost important trends and innovations shaping  \ntoday\u2019s O&M market are summarised in this chapter  \nand include the latest aerial monitoring techniques,  \nand AI, and data-driven decision making.  \n \nO&M for rooftop solar \nAll best practices mentioned in these Guidelines could \nbe theoretically applied to even the smallest solar  \nsystem for its benefit. However, this is not practical in \nnature due to a different set of stakeholders and  \nfinancial implications. This chapter assists in the  \napplication of the utility-scale best practices to  \ncommercial & industrial, and residential rooftop  \nprojects. These are shaped by three important factors: \n(1) a different set of stakeholders \u2013 owners of  \ndistributed systems not being solar professionals but \nhome owners and businesses, (2) different economics \n\u2013 monitoring hardware and site inspections accounting \nfor a larger share of investment and savings, and (3) a \nhigher incidence of uncertainty \u2013 greater shade, lower \ndata accuracy and less visual inspection.",

Rationale, aim and scope \nQuality must be present at every stage of an asset\u2019s  \nlifecycle to ensure that it operates smoothly. A  \nprofessional Operation & Maintenance (O&M) service \npackage ensures that a photovoltaic system will  \nmaintain high levels of technical, safety and  \nconsequently economic performance over its  \noperational lifetime. Tt is widely acknowledged by all  \nstakeholders that high quality O&M services are vital  \nto improving the overall quality management of an  \nasset\u2019s lifecycle, mitigating the potential risks,  \nimproving the levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) and \nPower Purchase Agreement (PPA) prices, and  \npositively impacting the return on investment (ROI).  \nTherefore, increasing the quality of O&M services is  \nimportant and, in contrast, neglecting O&M is risky.  \nHowever, O&M does not work in a vacuum and poor  \npractices at any stage of an asset\u2019s lifecycle can lead  \nto problems in the future.

The shear amount of additional solar capacity \nmeans that O&M service providers will be under  \ngreater scrutiny than ever to provide exceptional  \n\u201chealth care\u201d that keeps new solar PV plants running  \noptimally. This makes harmonisation of best practices \nmore vital than ever as Europe transitions to carbon  \nneutrality.

The practical implementation is normally \nsubcontracted to the O&M service provider. In some  \ncases, the Asset Manager can provide or prescribe the \nsystems, which are then implemented by the O&M  \nservice provider. This chapter will investigate specific \nareas of Health, Safety, Security, and Environmental  \n(HSSE) policy and coordination that relate to O&M  \nservice providers. For a general overview of the  \nfundamentals of HSSE coordination, please refer to  \nSolarPower Europe\u2019s Lifecycle Quality Guidelines V 1.0 \n(available at ww.solarpowereurope.org). \n \n2.1. Health, Safety, and Security \nManaging the risks that solar plants pose to the health \nand safety (H&S) of people, both in and around the  \nplant, is a primary concern of all stakeholders. Solar  \nplants are electricity generating power stations and  \npose significant hazards which can result in  \npermanent injury or death. Risks can be mitigated  \nthrough proper hazard identification, careful planning \nof works, briefing of procedures to be followed, and  \nregular and well documented inspection and  \nmaintenance (see also 5.8. Power plant security).  \nThe dangers of electricity are well known and can be  \neffectively managed through properly controlled  \naccess and supervision by the O&M service provider.  \nAny person accessing a solar PV power plant should  \nexpect some form of introduction to ensure they are  \nbriefed on any hazards and risks. Staff working on  \nelectrical equipment must be appropriately trained,  \nhave sufficient experience, and be supervised. It is also \nkey that others working around the equipment - for  \nexample panel cleaners - are equally aware of the  \npotential risks and have safe methods of working  \naround HV and LV electricity. \nHazardous areas and equipment should carry  \nappropriate markings to warn personnel of possible  \nhazards and wiring sequence. Such markings should  \nbe clear and evident to all personnel and third parties  \n(and intruders) entering the plant premises. \nAs well as the inherent dangers of a typical solar plant, \nevery site will have its own set of individual hazards  \nwhich must be considered when working on the plant. \nAn up-to-date plan of hazards is important for the  \nO&M service provider to manage their own staff and  \nprovide third party contractors with adequate  \ninformation. It is usually the case that the O&M service \nprovider holds the authority and responsibility for  \nreviewing and, where necessary, rejecting works taking \nplace in the plant. Failure to carry this out properly has \nimportant consequences for general safety. \nBesides workers on the solar plant, it is not unusual for \nother parties to require access to it. This may be the Asset \nOwner, or their representative, the landowner, or, in some \nsituations, members of the public. It is important that the \nplant access control and security system keeps people \naway from areas of danger and that they are  \nappropriately supervised and inducted as necessary. \nThe Asset Owner is ultimately responsible for  \ncompliance with H&S regulations within the site/plant. \nThe Asset Owner must make sure that the installation \nand all equipment meet the relevant legislations of the \ncountry and, that all contractors, workers, and visitors \nrespect the H&S Legislation by strictly following the  \nestablished procedures, including the use of  \nestablished personal protective equipment (PPE). \nHealth, Safety, Security,  \nand Environment\n2\n\u00a9 Thanit Pkc / Shutterstock",

Collisions can occur between personnel, \nmachinery/vehicles and structures. The large areas \ncovered by solar farms often necessitate the use  \nof vehicles and machinery which, when combined \nwith the generally quiet nature of an operational  \nsolar plant, can lead to a lack of attention. General \nrisks such as difficult terrain, reversing without a  \nbanksman and walking into the structure  \nsupporting the solar panels require special  \nattention. \n4. Strains and sprains. Lifting heavy equipment, often \nin awkward spaces or from uneven ground,  \npresents increased risk of simple strains or longer-\nterm skeletal injuries. \n5. Electrocution. Operational solar plants, whether  \nenergised or not, present a significant risk of  \nelectrocution to personnel. This risk is exacerbated \nby the nature and voltage of the electricity on site \nand the impossibility of total isolation. Staff  \nengaged in electrical work obviously suffer the  \ngreatest risk but everybody on site is at risk from  \nstep potential and other forms of electrocution in \nthe event of a fault. Specific training needs to be  \ngiven to all those entering a solar farm on how to  \nsafely deal with the effects of electrocution. In  \naddition to general electrical safety, common  \nissues for solar PV power plants include arc-flash  \nprotection when working on energized circuits;  \nand lock-out-tag-out to ensure circuits are not  \nunintendedly energised. \n6. Fire. Several sources of combustion exist on a solar \nfarm, the most common being electrical fire. Others \ninclude combustible materials, flammable liquids, \nand grass fires. Safe exit routes need to be identified \nand procedures fully communicated. All personnel \nneed to be fully aware of what to do to avoid the risk \nof fire and how to act in the event of a fire. \n7. Mud and water. Many solar farms have water  \ntravelling through them such as streams and rivers, \nsome have standing water, and some are floating  \narrays. Mud is a very common risk particularly in  \nwinter as low-grade farmland is often used for  \nsolar farms. Mud and water present problems for  \naccess as well as electrical danger. \n8. Mechanical injury. Hand-tools, power tools,  \nmachinery, and mechanisms such as unsecured  \ndoors can present a risk of mechanical injury on site. \nAt the same time, the O&M service provider should  \nprepare and operate their own safety management  \nsystems, previously agreed with the Asset Owner, that \ntake into account site rules relating to H&S and the  \npotential hazards involved in the works. The O&M  \nservice provider should ensure that they, and all  \nsubcontractors, comply with H&S legislation. \nThe Asset Owner will expect the O&M service provider \nto assume the role and duties of the principal  \ncontractor under the releva nt national regulations  \ngoverning H&S. This involves the O&M service provider \nproving that they are competent and are able to  \nallocate enough resources to fulfil these duties. \nBefore starting any activity on-site, the Asset Owner  \nwill deliver a risk assessment and method statements \nto the O&M service provider who will provide a  \ncomplete list of personnel training certifications and  \nappoint a H&S coordinator. During the whole duration \nof the contract the O&M service provider will keep the \nH&S file of each site up to date. \nThe O&M service provider must have their personnel  \ntrained in full compliance with respective national  \nlegal and professional requirements. This generally  \nincludes obtaining certification necessary for working \nin a variety of environments, such as MV and/or HV  \nelectrical plants. Within Europe, referral to European  \nStandards is not sufficient (examples of standards  \nused today are ISO 14001, OHSAS 18001 etc). \nTo achieve a safe working environment, all work must be \nplanned in advance. Normally written plans are required. \nRisk assessments which detail all the hazards present \nand the steps to be taken to mitigate them need to  \nbe produced.  \nThe following dangers are likely to exist on most solar \nplants and must be considered when listing hazards  \nand identifying risks. The severity of any injuries  \ncaused are exacerbated by the terrain on which solar \nplants are built and their remoteness. \n1. Medical problems.",

The weather presents a variety of hazards, \nthe most significant of which is the risk of lightning \nstrike during an electrical storm. Due to the metal \nstructures installed on a solar farm an electrical  \nstorm is more likely to strike the solar array than  \nsurrounding countryside. A solar farm MUST be  \nvacated for the duration of any electrical storm.  \nWorking in cold and rainy weather can cause fatigue \nand injury just as working in hot sunny weather  \npresents the risk of dehydration, sunburn, and sun \nstroke. Working during sunny days for undertaking \nmaintenance and/or testing on site can lead to  \nsunstroke. To avoid this, drinking sufficient water  \nand staying in the shade is recommended. \n10. Wildlife and livestock. The renewable energy  \nindustry is proud to provide habitats for wildlife  \nand livestock alongside the generation of  \nelectricity. Some wildlife, however, presents  \ndangers. There are plants in different regions which \ncan present significant risk, some only when cut  \nduring vegetation management. Animals such as  \nrodents and snakes, insects such as wasps, and  \nother wildlife and livestock can present significant \nrisks. The nature of these risks will vary from place \nto place, and personnel need to be aware of what  \nto do in the event of bites or stings. Snakes, spiders, \nticks, bees, and bugs are common and pose a  \nnumber of hazards where snake bites could be  \nlethal, spider bites can cause pain and  \ninflammation, tics bites could result in tick bite  \nfever, bees can cause allergic reactions and bugs  \ncould fly into people\u2019s eyes. It is therefore  \nimportant that all precautions are taken to prevent \nor manage these incidents. Storage and  \napplication of pesticides, herbicides, and rodent  \npoisons also introduce health and safety hazards. \nFor example, Glyphosate was very common in  \ncontrolling vegetation at solar PV power plants and \nhas been found to be carcinogenic. Mowing has  \nseveral hazards including flying objects. Every job  \nat a solar PV site should have safety precautions  \nidentified and implemented. \nEveryone entering a solar farm, for whatever reason,  \nshould have been trained in the dangers present on  \nsolar farms and be trained for the individual task that \nthey will be performed. They should have all the PPE and \ntools necessary to carry out the work in the safest way \npossible. The work should be planned, and everyone  \nconcerned should have a common understanding of all \naspects related to the safe execution of their task.  \nDifferent countries will mandate written and hard copy \npaperwork to meet legislation, but best practice is to  \nexceed the minimum requirements and to embrace  \nthe spirit of all relevant legislation. \nBest practice in H&S sees the ongoing delivery of  \ntraining and sharing of lessons learned. By increasing  \nthe skills of persons involved in the industry, we can  \nmake the industry safer and more productive. \n \n2.2. Environment \nRenewable energies are popular because of their low  \nenvironmental impact, and it is important that solar  \nplants are operated and maintained to minimise any  \nadverse effects. Environmental problems can normally \nbe avoided through proper plant design and  \nmaintenance \u2013 for example, bunds and regular  \ninspection of HV transformers will reduce the chances \nof significant oil leaks \u2013 but where issues do occur the \nO&M service provider must detect them and respond \npromptly. Beyond the environmental damage there may \nbe financial or legal penalties for the Owner of the plant. \nLegal obligations to be fulfilled by the O&M service  \nprovider (or the Technical Asset Manager) may include \nlong-term environmental requirements to be  \nimplemented either onsite or off-site. Typical  \nrequirements can be, amongst others, water tank  \ninstallation, tree clearing, drainage system installation, \namphibian follow-up, edge plantation, and reptile rock \nshelter installation. Such requirements should be  \nimplemented and managed by the O&M service  \nprovider to comply with the relevant regulations. As a \nbest practice, the O&M service provider\u2019s environmental \npreservation activities can go beyond legal obligations. \nOther aspects that need to be considered as best  \npractice, are recycling of broken panels and electric  \nwaste so that glass, aluminium and semiconductor  \nmaterials can be recovered and reused, and hazardous \nmaterials disposed of in a safe manner, complying  \nwith legal requirements. In areas with water scarcity, \nwater use for module cleaning should be minimised.",

End-of-life (EoL) management optimisation \u2013  \nsolar PV O&M for circularity \nBased to the latest available (2019) figures reported on \nthe growth of solar PV installations, we can estimate  \nthat about 1-1.2 million solar PV modules are installed \nevery day around the world. With this in mind and with \nan estimated average annual failure rate of 0.2% in the \nfield, we may anticipate today ~8 million solar PV  \nmodules to fail every year, corresponding to a weight of \n144 kt of potential annual solar PV waste from solar PV \nfailures only. Adding also other solar PV waste sources \nand streams, such as the decommissioning of solar PV \nmodules due to end of service lifetime, repowering,  \ninsurance claims, etc., the cumulative solar PV waste is \nexpected to reach up to 8 Mt by 2030. \nReported field experiences show that, most solar PV  \nmodules with diagnosed/classified failures that are  \ndecommissioned, follow a linear EoL management  \napproach: they enter the waste stream and are either \ndisposed as waste (the majority of the time) or  \nrecycled. Currently less than 10% of decommissioned \nmodules are recycled. However, experts from the IEA \nPVPS Task 13 and the CIRCUSOL project estimate that \n45%-65% of them, can be diverted from the  \ndisposal/recycling path, towards repair and second life \nsolar PV (re-use) or, as aforementioned, revamping. \nTo ensure the technical-economical bankability of  \nsolar PV re-use and second life solar PV, within the  \nO&M framework and the overall solar PV value chain,  \nit is important to:  \n\u2022 Identify the addressable \u201ctarget volume\u201d, i.e., the  \nfailed solar PV modules (or strings), the repair of  \nwhich is technically feasible, and the occurrence  \nor distribution of such failures. \n\u2022 Determine the post-repair efficiency and/or post-\nrevamping reliability of these modules. \n\u2022 Integrate optimal sorting-repair-reuse and logistics \nprocedures in the current solar PV O&M value chain, \nembracing circular economy business models. \nOn this basis, we identify certain future R&D pathways \nand challenges to be addressed, to support the  \ndevelopment, growth, and bankability of second life  \nsolar PV and circular solar PV O&M business: \n\u2022 Industrialisation and qualification of new solar PV  \nmodule designs-for-circularity: including \u201crepair-\nfriendly\u201d solar PV components, modular designs,  \nand deployment of repair technology solutions in  \nupscaled re-manufacturing lines.",

When well-managed and in \nsuitable locations, solar parks offer an opportunity to  \nimprove the state of the natural environment alongside \ntheir primary purpose of generating electricity. This  \npotential is becoming increasingly pertinent with the  \ndevelopment of national policies that prioritise the  \nenvironment, such as the UK Government\u2019s 25-Year  \nEnvironment Plan which stipulates the need for \u2018net  \nenvironmental gain\u2019, EU directives such as the Habitats \nDirective (92/43/EEC), and global frameworks such as \nthe Sustainable Development Goals. Further, promoting \ngood environmental stewardship will enhance the solar \nindustry\u2019s profile, contribute to corporate  \nEnvironmental, Social and Governance (ESG)  \nobjectives, help to meet planning policy goals, and  \nimprove community and landowner relations.  \n\u2018Ecosystem Services\u2019 and \u2018Natural Capital\u2019 are two  \nrelated frameworks that are being used to characterise \nand quantify the benefits that the environment provides \nfor us. Natural Capital is the stocks of environmental  \nassets (e.g., water, air, soil, and living material), from  \nwhich ecosystem goods (e.g., crops and drinking water) \nand ecosystem services (e.g., climate regulation and  \npollination) that society rely on are derived.  \nSolar parks offer an excellent and relatively untapped \nopportunity to enhance natural capital and ecosystem \nservices as they occupy a notable amount of land for \n25-40 years, which is predominantly used solely to  \nproduce low carbon energy. The land remains  \nrelatively undisturbed, apart from by maintenance  \nactivities. Moreover, because the parks are commonly \nlocated in agricultural landscapes, the land they  \noccupy and its immediate surroundings, stand to  \nbenefit significantly from enhancement. For example, \nintroducing pollinator habitats on solar parks could  \nimprove pollination of surrounding crops leading to  \nhigher yields, and changes to the intensity of mowing \nand grazing can be used to enhance biodiversity.  \nWithin the UK, collaborative research between solar  \npark stakeholders, nature conservation bodies and  \nresearchers has produced the Solar Park Impacts on  \nEcosystem Services (SPIES) decision support tool1. The \nSPIES tool provides an accessible, transparent, and  \nevidence-based means of informing management  \nactions on and around solar parks. It is free to use (see \nwww.lancaster.ac.uk/spies) and enables users to  \nexplore the impacts of different management  \nscenarios, which can be outputted as pdf documents \nsuitable to support planning applications.  \nWhilst currently deployed in a UK context, alternative \nversions of SPIES could be readily developed for other \nEuropean ecosystems. By engaging more actively in the \nnatural capital and ecosystem services agendas, the  \nEuropean solar industry would boost its environmental \ncredentials, enabling it to continue to produce urgently \nneeded low-carbon electricity while also improving the \nstate of the natural environment upon which society relies. \nThe SPIES tool is a collaboration between Lancaster  \nUniversity and the University of York funded by the  \nNatural Environment Research Council (NE/N016955/1 \n& NE/R009449/1). The web-based version of the SPIES \ntool was developed by Simomics Ltd.3\n3 For more information, see:  www.lancaster.ac.uk/SPIES  and \nwww.energyenvironment.co.uk.",

It comprises the activities presented in this  \nchapter. It is worth noting that TAM can be done by  \neither the O&M service provider or the Asset Manager. \nThe choice over whether to give TAM responsibilities  \nto the Asset Manager or the O&M service provider is  \nultimately down to the Asset Owner. For more  \ninformation on the role of the AM, please refer to  \nSolarPower Europe\u2019s Asset Management Best  \nPractice Guidelines V 2.0. \nIt is not easy to draw a sharp line between the high-\nlevel tasks of the Operations team and the more  \ntechnical responsibilities of the Asset Manager. A  \nsimple way to provide some clarity would be that TAM \nfocusses on the administrative environment of the  \nsolar PV power plant and Operations Management  \nfocusses on performance and data analysis. In many  \ncases, the O&M service provider assumes some tasks \nrelated to TAM, such as KPI reporting. The following  \ntasks can be regarded as TAM and can be performed  \nby the O&M service provider or the AM. In cases where \nthe Technical Asset Manager and the O&M service  \nprovider are separate entities, close coordination and \ninformation sharing between the two entities is  \nnecessary. This involves an integral knowledge about  \nhow much power a solar PV power plant should be  \nproducing for any given time, considering factors such \nas weather, seasons, or degradation of assets, etc,  \nensuring long-term energy infrastructure reliability. It  \nrepresents the entire value chain from investors to  \nAsset Managers and service providers.  \n \n4.1. Technical reporting \nThe Technical Asset Manager is responsible for  \npreparing and providing regular reporting to the Asset \nOwner and other stakeholders defined in the  \nagreement between the Asset Owner and the  \nTechnical Asset Manager.  \nThe frequency of the reporting should be relative to  \nthe level of TAM activity. Standard reporting can be set \nfor monthly, quarterly, or annually. Where specific TAM \nactions are underway, for example insurance claims or \nwarranty claims, reporting could be more frequent.  \nReport content should be specifically defined.  \nGenerating a report for any specific time range in the  \npast can also be possible. Detailed time-series data  \nshould also be reported or at least archived in the  \nreporting system to improve the correct availability  \ncalculations. The spatial resolution of reports should  \nbe on the level of each inverter to better detect under-\nperforming sections of the plants managed.  \nTable 1 includes some proposed quantitative and  \nqualitative indicators which should be in reports as a  \nminimum requirement, a best practice, or a  \nrecommendation. For more details on the individual  \nindicators, see Chapter 10. Key Performance Indicators. \nA new trend in the industry is to extend the reporting  \nbeyond the pure solar PV power plant indicators and  \nto incorporate reporting on the actual activities. This  \nmeans that both the Asset Manager and the O&M  \nservice provider can operate with an Asset  \nManagement Platform, ERP (Enterprise Resource  \nPlanner), or CMMS (Computerised Maintenance  \nManagement Systems) in order to measure various  \nO&M service provider KPIs (e.g., Acknowledgement  \nTechnical Asset  \nManagement\n4\n\u00a9 kan_chana, pixabay",

In  \nthis case, the security service provider is  \nresponsible for providing the relevant input. \nOn top of the periodic standard reports (monthly,  \nquarterly or yearly), where the Technical Asset Manager \nreports on operations activities to the Asset Owner , it is \na best practice for the Technical Asset Manager to  \nprovide an intermediate operation report when a fault is \ngenerating a major loss. A loss due to a fault is  \nconsidered major when PR and availability are affected \nby more than a certain threshold throughout the  \nongoing monitoring (or reporting) period. A best practice \nis to set this threshold to 1% of Availability or 1% PR  \nwithin a reporting period of one month. The report  \nshould be sent as soon as the fault is acknowledged or \nsolved and should contain all the relevant details related \nto it, together with recommendations for Extraordinary \nMaintenance when the necessary operations are not  \nincluded in the maintenance contract.  \nTypically, this maintenance report should contain:  \n\u2022 Relevant activity tracks (alarm timestamp,  \nacknowledgement time, comments, intervention  \ntime, description of on-site operations, pictures, etc.)  \n\u2022 The estimated production losses at the moment  \nof the report was written \n\u2022 The estimated production losses for the total  \nduration of the period, counting on the estimated  \nresolution time if the issue is not solved yet \n\u2022 The device model, type, and Serial Number when  \nthe fault is affecting a device \n\u2022 The peak power of the strings connected to the  \ndevice(s) \n\u2022 The alarm and status log as provided by the device \n\u2022 The resolution planning and suggestions  \n\u2022 Recommendations on whether a replacement is  \nneeded",

Examples include restrictions \nto the vegetation management and the disposal of \ngreen waste imposed by the environmental  \nadministration body or building permits restricting \nworking time on site or storage of utilities. \n\u2022 It is the O&M service provider\u2019s responsibility to  \nensure grid code compliance. See 5.6. Grid code  \ncompliance. It is the responsibility of the AM to  \nengage the District Network Operator in discussions \nwhich will minimise outages and identify measures \nto safe-guard export capabilities. \n\u2022 Other issues requiring formal compliance include  \nreporting of safety plans and incidents,  \nhistoric/cultural resource protection, noise  \nordinances that may limit work at night, and any  \nother regulations imposed by an authority having  \njurisdiction. \nAs a minimum requirement the O&M agreement should \nlist all the relevant permits, regulations and contracts \nthat are the responsibility of Technical Asset Manager \nand specify that the Asset Owner makes relevant  \ndocuments available to the Technical Asset Manager. \nAs a best practice, all regulations, permits and  \nstipulations should be managed within a regulatory  \nand contractual compliance system that is consistent \nwith the size and complexity of the solar PV power  \nplant.

During the warranty period, it is \nthe responsibility of the Technical Asset Manager to  \nmonitor, calculate, report and follow-up the PR and  \nother KPI values guaranteed by the EPC service provider. \nWithin this scope, it is the responsibility of the Technical \nAsset Manager to: \n\u2022 Manage the interventions done within the scope  \nof the warranty to safeguard the performance  \ncommitments undertaken in the contract. \n\u2022 Periodically inform the Asset Owner about the  \ncondition of the contracted performance  \nindicators. \n\u2022 Immediately alert the Asset Owner whenever the  \nlevels of the indicators have values or tendencies  \nthat could indicate a risk of failure. \n \n4.5.7. Warranty enforcement \nA warranty may be voided by mishandling or not  \nobserving instructions or conditions therein. For  \nexample, storing modules improperly on-site, such that \nthe packaging is destroyed by rain, may void a warranty. \nIn another case, partial shading of a thin-film module  \nvoids the warranty. Failure to provide adequate  \nventilation may void an inverter warranty. The  \nmanufacturer\u2019s warranty might cover a replacement  \nbut not the labour costs of removing, shipping, and re-\ninstalling an underperforming module. A warranty often \ngives the manufacturer the option to \u201crepair, replace, or \nsupplement,\u201d with \u201csupplement\u201d meaning to provide  \nmodules to make up the difference in lost power.

Liability of a fire started by the \nsolar PV system has increased required liability  \ncoverage levels for solar PV systems. A liability  \npolicy should cover negligence claims,  \nsettlements, and legal costs too. \n\u2022 Inland insurance or marine insurance : coverage  \nagainst loss of equipment in shipping or outside  \nthe property premises. Inland insurance is often  \ncovered under property insurance policy. \n\u2022 Worker compensation : coverage of costs for  \nemployee accidents. \n\u2022 Professional liability insurance : coverage against  \nerrors and omissions often required by board of  \ndirectors. \n\u2022 Commercial vehicle insurance : coverage for  \nowned, rented vehicles, and personal vehicles used \non company business. \n\u2022 Warranty insurance : equipment warranty issued  \nby manufacturer but backed up by an insurance  \ncompany in the event that the manufacturing  \ncompany goes out of business. Many insurance  \ncompanies do not offer warranty insurance but  \nrather cover such risk under property insurance. \n\u2022 Business interruption insurance: coverage for lost \nrevenue due to downtime caused by a covered  \nevent. This can be important in PPAs where  \nrevenue is essential for debt service and O&M  \nexpenditures. \n\u2022 Energy production insurance : coverage for when  \nenergy production is less than previously specified, \nwhich can improve access to debt financing and  \nreduce debt interest rate. \nFor any insurance claims the formal procedure  \npresented by the insurance provider should be  \nfollowed. All communications and reports should be  \narchived for compliance and traceability reasons. The \ninsurance company (claims adjuster) will need to have \naccess to the site to assess damage and to collect the \ninformation needed to process the claim. \n \n4.7. Contract management (operational contracts) \nContract management encompasses both technical  \nand commercial/financial aspects. This section looks \nat contract management from a Technical Asset  \nManagement point of view. For details on the  \nperspective of the Commercial/Financial Asset  \nManager, see section 7.13. Contract management  \n(financial contracts) of the Asset Management Best  \nPractice Guidelines.",

(For more information on  \nprocurement, please refer to the Asset Management  \nBest Practice Guideline\u2019s Chapter 8. Procurement.)  \nWhere the Technical Asset Manager and the O&M  \nservice provider roles are separate, the Technical Asset \nManager is responsible for coordination with the O&M \nservice provider and for overall performance  \nsupervision. They need to detect where systems are  \nunderperforming and be able to accurately diagnose  \nan underperforming plant. \nThe Technical Asset Manager oversees various  \ncontractual parameters, responsibilities and  \nobligations of the Asset Owner and the contractual  \npartners, linked to the respective solar power plant.  \nContract management responsibilities depend largely \non factors such as geographic location, project size,  \nconstruction and off-taker arrangements. \nEffective contract management requires a  \ncomprehensive analysis of the contracts to  \nunderstand the requirements of the parties to the  \ncontracts. This is followed by a well-defined Division  \nof Responsibility (DOR) matrix that clearly delineates \nwhich entity (on the Asset Owner\u2019s side of the  \ncontract) is responsible for which action on both the  \nshort and long term. Upon mutual agreement between \nthe parties, the DOR can serve as the driving and  \ntracking tool for term of life contractual oversight.  \nAs a form of best practice, the Technical Asset  \nManager\u2019s responsibilities often also extend to  \nfunctioning as the point of contact for all external  \nquestions. This allows the Asset Owner optimal access \nto all areas of the service provider\u2019s organisation and  \nhelps ensure adherence to the contractual  \nresponsibilities. The Technical Asset Manager also  \nassumes the responsibility for invoicing of the O&M  \nfees to the Asset Owner. \nFor quality purposes, the Technical Asset Manager  \nshould also track their own compliance with the  \nrespective contract, either an O&M or Asset  \nManagement contract, and report to the Asset Owner \nin full transparency.  \n4.8. Asset optimisation (technical) \nTo the extent that O&M service providers perform TAM \nfunctions, they will have to provide data and  \ninformation analysis on the assets they manage, and  \nprovide asset optimisation solutions based on the  \nfollowing key areas: \n\u2022 Plant performance \n\u2022 Operation cost reduction \n\u2022 Technology adaptation and upgrades (e.g.,  \nRevamping and repowering3) \n\u2022 Technical People management and training \nIt is the role of the Technical Asset Manager to initiate \nand coordinate discussions with the O&M service  \nprovider (where the roles are separate) and the Owner \nto future-proof the assets, and come up with a  \nfinancial proposal, based on data analysis, which can  \nassist the Owners in making informed decisions. \nNote that asset optimisation has commercial and  \nfinancial aspects too, such as contract optimisation,  \npresented in the Asset Management Best Practice  \nGuidelines. \n \n4.9. Environmental management \nDepending on local and international environmental  \nregulations, as well as on the Asset Owner\u2019s Corporate \nSocial Responsibility (CSR) and Environmental internal \npolicies, the Asset Owner may have incentives to  \nreduce or control negative environmental impacts. For \nmore information on effective environmental and  \nbiodiversity management, please refer to Chapter  \n2. Health, Safety, Security, and Environment.  \nA part of the Technical Asset Managment role is to  \nassess the impact or limitations of environmental  \nlegislation on the supplier\u2019s existing contracts and to  \ndevelop an action plan to address existing problems  \nand minimise their impact.  \nAs an example, the Technical Asset Manager oversees \nthe operational field work to ensure compliance with \nlocal environmental regulation (use of chemicals to  \ncontrol vegetation, use of diesel cutting machines,  \netc.); the security contract must be adapted, if  \npossible, according to the wildlife existing around the \n3 For detailed information about revamping and repowering, please refer \nto Chapter 7.

As a best practice, the  \nTechnical Asset Manager\u2019s (or the O&M service  \nprovider\u2019s) environmental preservation activities  \nshould go beyond legal obligations. \n \n4.10. Health & safety management \nThe Technical Asset Manager should ensure that the  \nsolar PV power plant and the relevant suppliers comply \nwith health & safety (H&S) requirements. If necessary, \nthe Technical Asset Manager should hire an H&S  \nexpert to ensure compliance. For more information,  \nsee Chapter 2. Health, Safety, Security, and  \nEnvironment. \n \n4.11. Technical Risk management  \nFor an effective technical risk management, the  \nTechnical Asset Manager should accurately quantify  \nappearing degradation modes and other performance \nimpairing effects in operating solar PV power plants.  \nTypical methods used in risk management are: Failure \nMode and Effect Analysis (FMEA), Failure Mode,  \nEffects & Criticality Analysis (FMECA), Fault Tree  \nAnalysis, Reliability Block Diagrams. Reliability  \npractices for technical risk management for the  \noperation of photovoltaic power systems are  \nincluded in emerging standardisation activities, such  \nas IEC TR 63292:2020 (active) and the IEC TS 63265  \n(undergoing the approval phase). One of the methods \nthat allows this type of assessment is the Cost  \nPriority Number (CPN) methodology first developed  \nin the H2020 project Solar Bankability. This  \nmethodology assesses the economic impact based  \non factors such as performance reduction and  \ndowntime, in the form of the metric CPN (Cost  \nPriority Number), expressed in \u20ac/kWp/year. The  \nmethodology helps to identify and classify technical  \nrisks and their economic impact by assigning a cost  \nmetric that, based on collected statistics, supports  \npreventive and corrective measures, which would  \nthen lower the impact of failures on the availability  \nand performance of a solar PV power plant.  \nMonitoring data should be used in combination with  \nthe information contained in maintenance tickets in  \norder to calculate the parameters needed for the  \ndetermination of the CPN .4 \nFor the correct and cost-effective determination of  \nthe CPN, the information flow from monitored data,  \nticketing platform and solar PV power plant metadata \nneeds to be fully automated (key parameters must be \nextracted from digital documents or databases) \nOnce the CPN metric is calculated for each event, it is \npossible to use the metric to benchmark assets within \na portfolio, to determine effective O&M strategies and \nto further optimise them. \n \n4 For details please refer to \u201cIdentification of technical risks in the  \nphotovoltaic value chain and quantification of the economic impact\u201d  \nhttps://doi.org/10.1002/pip.2857 and www.solarbankability.eu",

Power plant operation used to be a more  \npassive exercise in the past, but with increasing grid  \nintegration efforts, more active and flexible operation \nwill be required by grid operators.

The IEC 62446  \nstandard also covers the minimum requirements for  \nas-built documentation.  \nIn general, for optimum service provision and as a best \npractice, the O&M service provider should have access \nto all possible documents (from the EPC phase). The  \nSite Operating Plan is the comprehensive document  \nprepared and provided by the plant EPC service  \npovider, which lays out a complete overview of its  \nlocation, layout, electrical diagrams, components in  \nuse and reference to their operating manuals, HSSE  \nrules for the site and certain further topics. All detailed \ndrawings from the EPC service provider need to be  \nhanded over to the O&M service provider and being  \nstored safely for immediate access in case of solar PV \npower plant issues or questions and clarifications with \nregards to permits and regulation.  \nWhen storing documents, thought must be given to  \naccessibility. As a minimum, project documentation  \nshould be available in a searchable PDF format to  \nfacilitate the identification of key information.  \nMoreover, project drawings, such as the as-built  \ndesign, should be editable in case they need  \ncorrecting, or change management processes mean  \nthey need to be updated. \n \n5.1.2. Management and control \nRegarding the document control, the following  \nguidelines should be followed: \n\u2022 Documents should be stored either electronically  \nor physically (depending on permits/regulations) in \na location with controlled access. Electronic copies \nshould be made of all documents, and these  \nshould be searchable and editable \n\u2022 Only authorised people should be able to view or  \nmodify the documentation. A logbook of all the  \nmodifications should be kept. As a best practice,  \nlogbooks should at a minimum contain the  \nfollowing information: \n\u2022 Name of person, who modified the document \n\u2022 Date of modification \n\u2022 Reason for modification and further  \ninformation, e.g., link to the work orders and  \nservice activities \n\u2022 Versioning control should be implemented as a  \nbest practice. People involved should be able to  \nreview past versions and be able to follow through \nthe whole history of the document. The easiest  \nway to ensure this is through using an electronic  \ndocument management system, which should be \nconsidered a best practice. \n \n5.1.3. Record control \nA key point is that necessary data and documentation are \navailable for all parties in a shared environment and that \nalarms and maintenance can be documented in a  \nseamless way. Critical to the Operations team is that the \nmaintenance tasks are documented back to and linked \nwith the alarms which might have triggered the respective \nmaintenance activity (work order management system \nlog). Photographs from the site should complement the \ndocumentation (when applicable). Tickets (ticket  \ninterventions) should be stored electronically and made \navailable to all partners. The Asset Owner should also  \nmaintain ownership of these records for future references. \nTo improve future performance and predictive  \nmaintenance, it is crucial to keep a record of past and \nongoing O&M data, work flows and alarms. This record \nshould seek to link these elements in a cost-effective \nway, following an agreed naming convention. This will \nimprove accessibility and allow for easier tracing,  \nfacilitating comprehensive lessons learned exercises, \nand resulting in concrete future recommendations for \nthe client. These analyses should also be recorded.  \nThere should be proper documentation for  \ncurtailment periods as well as repair periods when the \nplant is fully or partly unavailable. This will all be  \nrecorded by the monitoring system to measure the  \nenergy lost during maintenance activities. For this,  \nhaving the correct reference values at hand is crucial. \nFor important examples of input records that should  \nbe included in the record control, see Annex d.  \nAs in the case of the as-built documentation, all  \nrecords, data and configuration of the monitoring tool, \nand any sort of documentation and log that might be  \nuseful for proper service provision must be backed up \nand available when required.

Their \nknowledge and access rights may be not sufficient \nin some situations, but they can fix most faults to \nan adequate level. They may also contact the  \nvendor\u2019s hotline to help them with the diagnosis. \n\u2022 If 1 st Level Support is not able to resolve the  \nincident right away, it will escalate it to 2nd Level  \nSupport.

Special attention should be paid to the  \nfact that KPI calculations should take into  \nconsideration the contractual parameters between  \nO&M service provider and Asset Owner, to provide an \naccurate and useful calculation for evaluation and  \neventually liquidated damages or bonuses. \n \n5.3. Optimisation of O&M \nAn essential part of Operations is the analysis of all the \ninformation generated throughout O&M, such as  \nResponse Time, and how this correlates to the various \nclassifications of events and root causes. Another vital \npart of Operations is the analysis of costs incurred for \nvarious interventions, categorised into materials and  \nlabour. Having such information helps to further  \noptimise the asset by reducing production losses and \nthe cost of O&M itself. For more information on  \noptimisation of O&M please refer to Chapter 6. Power \nPlant Maintenance  and Chapter 8. Spare Parts  \nManagement. \n \n5.4. Power plant controls \nIf applicable, the Operations team can be the point of \ncontact for the grid operator for plant controls. The  \nOperations team will control the plant remotely (if  \npossible) or instruct the qualified maintenance  \npersonnel to operate breakers/controls on site. The  \nO&M service provider is responsible for the remote  \nplant controls or emergency shutdown of the plant (if \npossible) and in accordance with the respective grid  \noperator requirements (see also 5.6. Grid code  \ncompliance), regulations (see 4.4. Interface with local \nenergy authorities & regulatory compliance) and the \naggregator\u2019s requirements. The plant control function \nvaries from country to country and in some cases  \nfrom region to region. The respective solar PV power  \nplant control document for the area details regulations \nissued by the grid operator and (energy market)  \nregulator. \nThe Power Plant Controller itself is a control system  \nthat can manage several parameters such as active  \nand reactive power and ramp control of solar PV  \npower plants. The set points can normally be  \n\u2022 If an incident requires special expertise or access, \n2nd Level engineers might need to contact experts \n(in-house or from the vendor or a third party). This \nis known as 3rd level support. In some organisations \nthe Project/Account Managers can cover both 2nd \nand 3rd Level Support, based on their seniority and \nexperience. \n\u2022 When the fault is solved, the Operations Center  \ncloses the ticket. \nBesides the data from the site, if a CCTV system is  \navailable on-site, the O&M service provider should, as \na best practice, be able to access it for visual  \nsupervision and also have access to local weather  \ninformation. \nThe O&M service provider is responsible for being the \nmain interface between the plant Owner, the grid  \noperator, and the regulator (if applicable) over the  \nlifetime of the O&M contract regarding production  \ndata. The Asset Owner should be able to contact the  \nOperations team via a hotline during daytime, when  \nthe system is expected to generate electricity.

Forecasting may have an  \ninfluence on the contract agreement for electricity  \ndispatching between the Asset Owner and a trading  \nservice provider.  \nThe requirements for forecasts may differ from  \ncountry to country and also depend on the contract  \nagreement for electricity dispatching between the  \nAsset Owner and a trading service provider. Forecast  \nrequirements are characterised by the forecast  \nhorizon, the time resolution, and the update frequency, \nall depending on the purpose. For power system or  \npower market related purposes, forecast horizons are \ntypically below 48 hours and the time resolution is 15 \nminutes to one hour, in line with the programme time \nunit of the power system or the market. Common  \nproducts are day-ahead forecasts, intra-day forecasts \nand combined forecasts. Day-ahead forecasts are  \ntypically delivered in the morning for the next day  \nfrom 0 to 24 and updated once or twice during that  \nday. Intraday forecasts are delivered and updated  \nseveral times per day for the rest of the day and should \nbe delivered automatically by the forecast provider.  \nFor long-term planning of unit commitment and  \nmaintenance decisions, forecasts with longer time  \nhorizons are used, typically one week or more. \nSolar PV Power Generation Forecasts rely on  \nnumerical weather predictions, satellite data and/or  \nstatistical forecasting and filtering methods. Most  \nproducts combine several of these techniques. Good \npractice requires numerical weather predictions for  \nday-ahead forecasting and a combination with  \nsatellite data for intra-day forecasts. In all cases, good \npractice requires statistical filtering which in turn  \nrequires a near-real-time data feed from the  \nmonitoring system to the forecast provider. For best  \npractice, the forecast provider should also be  \ninformed about scheduled outages and the expected \nduration of forced outages. \nThe most common KPIs for forecast quality are the  \nRoot Mean Square Error (RMSE) and the Mean  \nAbsolute Error (MAE). They are normalised to peak  \npower and not to energy yield. \n \n5.6. Grid code compliance  \nThe O&M service provider, and in particular the  \nOperations team is responsible for operating the solar \nPV power plant in accordance with the respective  \nnational grid code. The operator of the grid to which it \nis connected (either low voltage grid or medium  \nvoltage grid or high voltage grid) provides the  \nrequirements for power quality, voltage regulation and \nmanagement of active and reactive power. In some  \ncountries (and/or regions) specific grid codes for  \nrenewable energy generators have been issued. \nDepending on the voltage level of the grid the plant is \nconnected to, the specificities and quality  \nrequirements for the solar PV power plant change.  \nGrids with a higher voltage level usually have more  \nspecific and demanding requirements. \nMost of the grid-connected utility scale solar PV  \npower plants in Europe must undergo an external test \nto meet the grid operator requirements. These plant  \ntests allow the grid operator to adjust the power  \noutput from the solar PV power plant according to the \ngrid capacity and power frequency requirements. \nThe O&M service provider is expected to be familiar  \nwith all the details of the grid code and grid operator  \nrequirements. Depending on the regulations, either the",

Management of change \nIf the design of a solar PV power plant needs to be  \nadjusted after the Commercial Operation Date, the O&M \nservice provider should, as a best practice, be involved \nby the Asset Owner and the EPC service provider. They \ncan even be a main contributor, if not the leader, of this \nchange process. Reasons for such changes can be  \nmotivated by non-compliance of the solar PV power  \nplant with the capacity predicted by the EPC service  \nprovider, by regulation change (introduction of new solar \nPV power plant controls regulations), by the  \nunavailability of spare parts or components, or for an  \nupgrade to the solar PV power plant. These events can \ntrigger new design works, procurement and installation \nof new equipment and adjustment of O&M procedures \nand/or documentation. It may also impact certain  \nperformance commitments or warranties provided by \nthe O&M service provider, which will need to be adjusted. \nThe O&M service provider should be involved in  \nchanges to the solar PV power plant from the  \nbeginning. Concepts, design works, and execution  \nneed to be coordinated with ongoing O&M activities.  \nAny changes should also be reflected in the plant  \nSCADA and monitoring systems. For data continuity  \nand long-term analysis, the monitoring system should \nbe able to trace all changes of electrical devices. This \nshould include documentation of inverter replacement \ndate, manufacturer and type, and serial number in a  \nstructured way for further analysis (e.g., spare part  \nmanagement, Predictive Maintenance analysis). The  \nmonitoring of replaced devices will also help the O&M \nservice provider verify that the new component is  \ncorrectly configured and is sending high quality data.  \nAdjustments to the Site Operating Plan, the Annual  \nMaintenance Plan and the Annual Maintenance  \nSchedule need to be applied and the O&M service  \nprovider needs to familiarise the O&M staff with the  \noperating manuals of the new equipment. These types \nof changes will have an impact on Spare Parts  \nManagement and inventory (replacement). Depending \non the significance of the change, the O&M annual fee \nmight need to be adjusted. \nIt is advisable that the O&M service provider lead these \nsorts of change processes. The O&M service provider \nis the trusted partner of the Asset Owner and should  \nadvise the Owner when they are making decisions on \nchanges to the plant. In the case of major changes, the \nOwner should also consider informing lenders about  \nthe decision process and provide concepts, proposals, \ncalculations and updates.  \nThe fixed O&M fee does not usually cover change  \nservices. The Asset Owner and the O&M service  \nprovider should manage changes in a formalised way. \nThis procedure should include the following steps:  \ndescription of proposed change (including time plan,  \ncosts, consequences, and alternatives), authorisation \nof the change by the Asset Owner, realisation of the  \nchange, documentation by the O&M service provider  \nand acceptance. \n \n5.8. Power plant security \nIt is important that the solar PV power plant, or key  \nareas of it, are protected from unauthorised access.  \nThis serves the dual purpose of protecting the plant\u2019s \nequipment and keeping members of the public safe.  \nUnauthorised access may be accidental with people  \nwandering into the plant without realising the  \ndangers, or it may be deliberate for the purposes of  \ntheft or vandalism.  \nTogether with the O&M service provider and the security \nservice provider, the Asset Owner must put in place a \nSecurity Protocol in case an intrusion is detected. \nIn most countries there are strict legal requirements for \nsecurity service providers. Therefore, solar PV power  \nplant security should be ensured by specialised security \nservice providers subcontracted by the O&M service  \nprovider. The security service provider will be  \nresponsible for the proper functioning of all the security \nequipment including intrusion and surveillance  \nsystems. They are also responsible for processing  \nalarms from the security system by following the  \nSecurity Protocol and the use of the surveillance  \nsystems installed on site. The security system provider \nwill be also responsible for any site patrolling or other \nrelevant services. The security service provider should \nalso assume liability for the security services provided. \nThe O&M service provider will coordinate with the  \nsecurity service provider and may choose to act as an \nintermediary with the Asset Owner. \n5 Power Plant Operation  /  continued\nOperation & Maintenance Best Practice Guidelines / Version 5.0 38",

If solar PV power plants have \nCCTV systems in place, an access protocol would be  \nrequired when reactive and planned works are carried \nout. This will ensure that authorised access is always  \nmaintained. This can be done by way of phone with  \npasswords or security pass codes, both of which  \nshould be changed periodically. \nFor additional security and in high-risk areas it is  \nadvisable to have a backup communication line  \ninstalled (often, the first thing that gets damaged in  \ncase of vandalism is communication with the  \nsurveillance station) as well as an infrastructure for  \nmonitoring connectivity and communication with the \nsecurity system. As well as any remote monitoring, it  \nis likely that provision for onsite attendance is required \nwhen significant events occur. Processes for liaising  \nwith local emergency services should be considered. \nWithin the solar plant, there may also be additional  \nareas with restricted access, for example locations  \ncontaining High Voltage equipment. When authorising \naccess to the parks it is important that all workers and \nvisitors are appropriately informed of the specific  \naccess and security arrangements and where they  \nshould or should not be. Warning signs and notices can \nform an important part of this and may be compulsory \ndepending on local regulations. \nAs well as the general security of the site over the  \nlifetime of the park, particular attention should be  \nmade to periods of construction or maintenance  \nwhen usual access arrangements may be different. It \nis important that security is always maintained  \nparticularly when there are activities that may be of  \nmore interest to members of the public or thieves. \nThe Asset Owner will likely have insurance policies in  \nplace directly or indirectly and these will be dependent \non certain levels of security and response being  \nmaintained. Failure to meet these may have important \nconsequences in the case of an accident or crime.  \n \n5.9. Reporting and Technical Asset Management \nThe Operations team is responsible for providing  \nperiodic reporting to the AM or directly to the Asset  \nOwner. In many cases, the Operations team also  \nassumes further TAM responsibilities. For more details \non reporting and other TAM tasks, see Chapter  \n4. Technical Asset Management.",

In  \nmodern solar PV power plants, automation of  \nmaintenance tasks is becoming more prevalent.  \nHowever, this practice is still developing and is not  \nwidespread currently. The following figure provides an \noverview of the four main types of power plant  \nmaintenance. \n \n6.1. Preventive maintenance \nPreventive Maintenance activities are the core  \nelement of the maintenance services to a solar PV  \npower plant. It comprises regular visual and physical  \ninspections, as well as verification activities.  \nThe maintenance of all key components is carried out \nat predetermined intervals or at least according to  \nprescribed OEM and O&M manuals. These are included \nin a detailed Annual Maintenance Plan which provides \nan established time schedule with a specific number  \nof iterations for carrying out the maintenance.  \nIt must also maintain the equipment and component \nwarranties in place and reduce the probability of failure \nor degradation. The activities must also be consistent \nwith respective legal issues such as national standards \nfor periodic inspection of certain electrical components. \nIt should be noted that the various maintenance  \nactivities that an O&M service provider is expected to \ncarry out require personnel qualified to carry them out. \nThe O&M service provider must ensure that they have \nthe appropriate range of skills available to fulfil their  \ncontractual obligations (for more information on  \nmaintenance activities and the skills they require, see \nAnnex b of these Guidelines and Annex a of the Lifecycle \nQuality Guidelines). The O&M contract should include \nthis scope of services and each task frequency. \nIt is the responsibility of the O&M service provider to  \nprepare the task plan, according to the time intervals  \nin the contract.  \nThe \u201c Annual Maintenance Plan \u201d (see Annex e  or  \ndownload it from www.solarpowereurope.org ) \ndeveloped as an attachment of this report includes a  \nlist of regular inspections per equipment (e.g., module, \ninverter etc) and per unit of equipment (e.g., sensors,  \nfuses etc). \nAn example of Preventive Maintenance is  \nthermographic inspection which aims to identify  \ndefective panels on a solar PV power plant. Indeed,  \nseveral categories of anomalies (hot spots, hot strips, \nmoisture ingress, soling, etc.) can occur, significantly  \nreducing the whole plant productivity. Relevant  \ninspection procedures are performed either by  \noperators with handheld cameras or using remotely  \npiloted drones or piloted aircraft equipped with  \ndedicated thermal and optical payloads. \nPreventive Maintenance also includes ad-hoc  \nreplacement of parts of inverters or sensors. In general, \nit is important to follow detailed Preventive  \nMaintenance procedures, which are agreed upon in  \nthe Annual Maintenance Plan. \nIn cases where downtime is necessary to perform  \nPreventive Maintenance, its execution during the night \nwould be considered best practice as the overall  \npower generation is not affected. \n\u00a9 only_kim / Shutterstock",

It comprises regular \nvisual and physical inspections, as well as verification that all the key components of the solar plant are in good \nworking order. This maintenance is carried out at predetermined regular intervals according to prescribed OEM &\nO&M manuals and are included in the \u201cAnnual Maintenance Plan\u201d.\nCorrective Maintenance\nCorrective Maintenance corresponds to any activity performed to restore a PV plant system, equipment or \ncomponent to a functioning state, and occurs after a failure detection by remote monitoring or during an on-site \ninspection. Corrective Maintenance includes Fault Diagnosis, Temporary Repair & Repair and can be divided into \n3 levels of intervention: Intervention without the need of substitution, with the need of substitution and with the \nneed to intervene on the software of a device.\nExtraordinary Maintenance\nExtraordinary Maintenance actions are necessary when major unpredictable events require substantial activities \nto restore the previous plant conditions. These interventions are required for damages due to Force Majeure, \ndamages due to a theft or fire, endemic failures of the equipment, modifications required by regulatory changes \nand equipment wear or deterioration due to design faults.\nAdditional Services\nThe O&M agreement can foresee services other than electrical and mechanical plant maintenance. Some of these \nadditional services are generally included in the scope of work and the O&M annual fixed fee and some are not. \nAdditional services include PV site maintenance activities such as panel cleaning and vegetation control, \ngeneral site maintenance tasks like waste disposal and maintenance of buildings and on-site measurements \nsuch as I-V curve measurement on modules or thermal inspections.\nPredictive Maintenance\nPredictive Maintenance is a condition-based intervention carried out following a forecast derived from the analysis \nand evaluation of the significant parameters of the degradation of an item. The site must have \u201cintelligent\u201d \nequipment and an appropriate monitoring software system, allowing the Operations team to perform regular \nmonitoring, supervision, forecast and performance data analysis of the main equipment of the PV plant \n(transformer, inverter, combiner box and/or DC array).",

Extraordinary Maintenance).  \nThe scope of Corrective Maintenance activities and its \n\u201cborder\u201d or definition with respect to Preventive  \nMaintenance requires specific attention and it should \nbe properly defined in the Maintenance contract. For an \neasier comprehension, an example is presented below: \n\u2022 A cable termination tightening activity using a  \ntorque device for correct fixation should be under  \nthe Preventive Maintenance scope of works, but  \ndepending on the quantity and/or frequency, it  \ncould be considered a Corrective Maintenance  \nactivity.

Corrective maintenance \nCorrective Maintenance covers the activities  \nperformed by the Maintenance team to restore a solar \nPV power plant system, equipment or component to  \na status where it can perform the required function.  \nCorrective Maintenance takes place after a failure  \ndetection either by remote monitoring and  \nsupervision or during regular inspections and specific \nmeasurement activities (see Annex e). \nCorrective Maintenance includes three activities:  \n1.

This is most often \na problematic manufacturer/model/serial number but \nmay also be linked to installation errors or  \nenvironmental conditions such as temperature inside \nenclosures. Corrective Maintenance processes should \nalso track the efficacy of responses to problems (what \nfixes the problem reliably?). \nCorrective Maintenance can be divided into three  \nlevels of intervention (See Table 2) to restore the  \nfunctionality of a device, that could be included in the \nO&M agreement or billed separately on hourly rates.\nOperation & Maintenance Best Practice Guidelines / Version 5.0 42\nTABLE 2  THREE LEVELS OF CORRECTIVE MAINTENANCE  \nLEVEL OF \nINTERVENTION\nCHARACTERISTICS REQUIRED LABOUR SKILL EXAMPLE ACTIVITY\n1st level No need for substitution Maintenance team Restart of an inverter \n2nd level Substitution of a \ncomponent \nMaintenance team/solar PV \nEngineer \nSubstitute a fan to restore inverter \nfunctionality \n3rd level* Intervention on the \nsoftware \nSolar PV Engineer/3rd party \nexpert \nReconfiguration or Parameterisation of \nan inverter",

Predictive maintenance \nPredictive Maintenance is a special service provided  \nby O&M service providers who follow best practices  \nprinciples. It is defined as a condition-based  \nmaintenance carried out following a forecast derived \nfrom the analysis and evaluation of the significant  \nparameters of the degradation of the item (according \nto EN 13306). A prerequisite for a good Predictive  \nMaintenance is that the devices on-site can provide  \ninformation about their state, in such a way that the  \nO&M service providers can evaluate trends or events  \nthat signal deterioration in a device. As a best practice, \nthe device manufacturer should provide a complete  \nlist of status and error codes produced by the device, \ntogether with the detailed description of their  \nmeaning and their impact on the functioning of the  \ndevice. Additionally, a standardisation of status and  \nerror codes through inverters and dataloggers from  \nthe same brand should be followed and, in the future, \nthis standardisation should be common to all  \nmanufacturers.  \nStakeholders that wants to benefit from Predictive  \nMaintenance should, as a best practice, select  \n\u201cintelligent\u201d equipment set with sufficient sensors,  \nand opt for a monitoring software system that  \nprovides basic trending and comparison (timewise or \nbetween components and even between solar PV  \nsites) functionalities (minimum requirement).  \nThe Operations team of the O&M service provider  \nenables Predictive Maintenance thorough continuous \nor regular monitoring, supervision, forecast and  \nperformance data analysis (e.g., historical performance \nand anomalies) of the solar PV power plant (at the DC \narray, transformer, inverter, combiner box or/and string \nlevel). This can identify subtle trends that would  \notherwise go unnoticed until the next round of circuit \ntesting or thermal imaging inspection and that indicate \nupcoming component or system failures or  \nunderperformance (e.g., at solar PV modules, inverters, \ncombiner boxes, trackers., etc. level).  \nBefore deciding which Predictive Maintenance actions \nto recommend, the Operations team should  \nimplement and develop procedures to effectively  \nanalyse historical data and faster identify behaviour  \nchanges that might jeopardise systems performance. \nThese changes of behaviour are usually related to the \npre-determined or unpredicted equipment  \ndegradation process. For this reason, it is important to \ndefine and to monitor all significant parameters of  \nwear-out status, based on the sensors installed,  \nalgorithms implemented into the supervision system \nand other techniques. \nFollowing such analysis, the Maintenance team can  \nimplement Predictive Maintenance activities to  \nprevent any possible failures which can cause safety  \nissues and energy generation loss. \nFor efficient Predictive Maintenance, a certain level of \nmaturity and experience is required, which is at best  \na combination of knowledge of the respective  \nsystem\u2019s performance, related equipment design,  \noperation behaviour, and relevant the service  \nprovider\u2019s track record. Normally it is a process that  \nstarts after the implementation of an appropriate  \nmonitoring system and the recreation of a baseline.  \nThis baseline will then represent the entire solar PV  \nsystem operation, how different pieces of equipment \ninteract with each other, and how the system reacts  \nto \u201cenvironmental\u201d changes.  \nPredictive Maintenance has several advantages,  \nincluding:  \n\u2022 Optimising the safety management of equipment  \nand systems during their entire lifetime \n\u2022 Helping to anticipate maintenance activities (both \ncorrective and preventive) \n\u2022 Delaying, eliminating and optimisinge some  \nmaintenance activities \n\u2022 Reducing time for repairs and optimising  \nmaintenance and Spare Parts Management costs \n\u2022 Reducing spare parts replacement costs \n\u2022 Increasing availability, energy production and  \nperformance of equipment and systems \n\u2022 Reducing emergency and non-planned work \n\u2022 Improving predictability \nThe following four specific examples show how  \nPredictive Maintenance might be implemented. \nExample 1 \nAn O&M service provider signs a new contract for a  \nsolar PV power plant equipped with central inverters.  \nAnalysing its backlog of maintenance, the O&M  \nservice provider knows that these inverters showed  \nsigns of power loss due to overheating at several",

An \u201cair flow inspection\u201d was performed,  \nprior to any emergency action being required, to  \ndetermine whether power loss was related to air flow. \nThis type of activity is a condition-based inspection  \nperformed after the detection of a change in a  \nsignificant parameter. It is also considered as a type of \nPredictive Maintenance. The final purpose is to  \nidentify if, for example, the ventilation systems will  \nneed some upgrade, replacement, or if there is any  \ntype of air flow obstruction or even if a filter  \nreplacement or cleaning is required. \nExample 2 \nPredictive Maintenance for optimised hardware  \nreplacement cycle relying on big data analytics or  \nartificial intelligence.

Prolonged periods \nof time between cleans can result in bird droppings  \netching modules and lichen growth, both of which can \nbe extremely difficult to remove. The intensity and type \nof soiling depend heavily on the location of the solar PV \nsystem (e.g., its proximity to industrial areas, agricultural \nland, or railway lines). \nModule cleaning methods therefore vary from manual, \nto robotic and mechanical and each have their own  \nadvantages and disadvantages. The frequency of  \ncleaning should be decided on a site-by-site basis, and \nit may be that certain parts of a site will need cleaning \nmore often than other parts of the same site.  \nWhen choosing a module cleaning company, Asset  \nOwners and O&M service providers should check the \nfollowing: \n\u2022 The suggested method of cleaning is fully in-line  \nwith the module manufacturer\u2019s warranty and  \naccording to specifications from IEC 61215 (e.g.,  \nmaximum pressure load). \n\u2022 The modules should be cleaned with high quality,  \nultra-pure water, not tap, mains or borehole water. \nDetergents must be biodegradable and comply  \nwith local environmental regulations. \n\u2022 H&S considerations should be made with regard to \nkeeping staff safe on site. This should include some \nform of H&S accreditation and specific training for \nsolar module cleaning, including working at height, \nif cleaning roof mounted modules. \nTable 3 on the following page presents a non-exhaustive \nlist of Additional services. For more information on  \nwhether these additional services are generally included \nin the O&M agreement or not, see 11.2. Scope of the  \nO&M contract. \nSome of these items can be considered as a part of  \nPreventive Maintenance. This depends on the  \nagreement between the Asset Owner and the O&M  \nservice provider. \nFrom a technological point of view, the usage of aerial \ninspections is beneficial to efficiently (time and costs) \nobtain a context awareness needed to perform better \nplanning of site maintenance activities as well as  \nexecution of on-site measurements (specifically  \nthermographic inspections). \n \n6.5.2. Advanced aerial thermography  \nThe general functionality of thermographic data is  \nfurther outlined in Chapter 9.11.1. Infrared  \nthermography. While thermographic inspections have \nbecome well established as a tool in preventive and  \ncorrective maintenance scheduling, the amount of  \neffort and manual labour required for data gathering  \nin the field has posed financial and operational  \nchallenges for their widespread use.  \nUsing thermographic cameras mounted on drones  \n(Remotely Piloted Aircrafts, RPAs or Unmanned Aerial \nVehicles, UAVs) or purpose-modified piloted aircraft,  \ninstead of handheld devices, the operator flies over  \nthe solar PV modules to capture thermographic  \nimages or videos. This data is then analysed to create \ninspection reports which can be used to form the  \nbasis of Preventive and Corrective Maintenance tasks. \nIf deployed properly, aerial thermography can provide \nseveral operational and financial advantages.

Vegetation Management \nVegetation management can represent a significant  \nportion of the operations costs of a solar PV system.  \nSome key items to consider in vegetation  \nmanagement: \n\u2022 Damage Reduction: Vegetation management can  \nreduce direct mechanical damage caused by  \nvegetation - especially woody vegetation - growing \ninto modules and structures. Damage can also be  \ncaused by direct shading causing hot-spot  \nformation on modules, potentially leading to long-\nterm module damage. \n\u2022 Performance Enhancement: Vegetation can cause \nmodule shading, which leads to degraded module  \nperformance. This effect is disproportionate to the \namount of shading, so a small amount of shading  \ncan cause a significant amount of power loss. \n\u2022 Erosion Control: Vegetation is critical for soil  \nstabilisation and avoidance of erosion damage on  \nsites. Uncontrolled erosion can cause significant  \nstructural damage on a project over time. \n\u2022 Carbon Sequestration: Continuous vegetation  \nmanagement can assist in increasing soil carbon  \nsequestration, especially with the use of grazing  \nanimals, who are able to fertilize the soil while  \nenhancing soil carbon capture. \n\u2022 Biodiversity Enhancement: The use of natural  \npollinators and native vegetation can enhance local \nbiodiversity. This can improve community  \nengagement, lead to reduced vegetation  \nmanagement costs, and in some cases add  \nrevenue streams to a project. \n6 Power Plant Maintenance  /  continued\nOperation & Maintenance Best Practice Guidelines / Version 5.0 48",

Definition and rationale of revamping and  \nrepowering  \nRevamping and repowering are defined as the  \nreplacement of old, power production related  \ncomponents of a power plant with new components  \nto enhance its overall performance. Revamping  \ninvolves component replacement, but without  \nsubstantially changing the plant's nominal power,  \nwhereas repowering involves increasing it. The  \ndi\ufb00erence between revamping and repowering, and  \nordinary replacement is that the former aims to  \nincrease performance by exchanging all components \nwithin a functional area or a significant ratio of them.  \nThe following sections focus principally on repowering \nbut also broadly apply to revamping and even repairs  \nand Extraordinary Maintenance. \nThere are several reasons why repowering of solar PV \npower plants can be a necessary and/or beneficial  \ninvestment. For an overview, see the following figure. \nThere are numerous ways of repowering a solar PV  \npower plant. In the following we will concentrate on  \nthe two most important opportunities of module and \ninverter repowering.\n7.2.  Module repowering  \nModules with irreparable defects that cannot be  \ndirectly replaced in a like-for-like swap may force the \ninvestor to consider a module repowering. This can be \ncarried out for the entire solar PV power plant or for  \nspecific parts. When repowering is focused on partial  \nmodule replacement, exchanging more modules than \nis technically required is advised as this keeps old  \nmodules intact as spare parts for the future.  \nDue to the rapid development of solar PV technology  \nit is not very likely that the same components are still \navailable on the market in the required quantity or at a \ncompetitive price. Certainly, exchanging identical  \nmodules would make repowering very simple.  \nHowever, this would mean spending money to  \nmaintain performance, instead of taking advantage of \nopportunities to raise efficiency at a lower  \nproportional cost. Where different modules are used  \nfor the repowering project, the following aspects need \nto be considered during planning and execution: \n \n7.2.1. Mechanical installation \n\u2022 If the modules have different dimensions in height, \nlength and width, compatibility with the mounting  \nsystem needs to be considered. Often adaptive  \nchallenges can be solved by applying new module  \nclamps but in extreme cases (e.g., changing from  \nthin film to crystalline modules) a new mounting  \nstructure needs to be installed. To save widespread \nchanges to the plant\u2019s infrastructure, agile  \nrepowering strategies such as changing from  \ncentral to string inverters, replacing transformers  \netc. should be considered. \n \u00a9 greentech\nOperation & Maintenance Best Practice Guidelines / Version 5.0 50",

Electrical installation \n\u2022 Depending on the rated power and the electrical  \ncharacteristics of the new module type a new string \ndesign can be inevitable. The maximum DC power, \nvoltage and current need to be in-line with the  \ninverter requirements. \n\u2022 A mix of different electrical characteristics at one  \ninverter or at least one MPP tracker should be  \navoided. Alternatively, bypass diodes can be  \nintegrated as protection in case of failures such as \nreverse current. \n\u2022 It is likely that the new module type will have  \ndifferent connectors. Therefore, the string cable  \nconnector needs to be replaced accordingly. \n\u2022 The dimensioning of existing cables and fuses  \nneeds to be checked and verified to ensure it is  \nsuitable for the new DC-layout. \n \n7.2.3. Further considerations \n\u2022 A module repowering might contain various  \nregulatory aspects, which will vary from country to \ncountry. The regulatory body should be contacted  \nwell in advance to clarify aspects such as: \n\u2022 Maximum power to be installed \n\u2022 Requirements for proving the faults of modules \n\u2022 Registration of new modules \n\u2022 Disposal of old modules \n \u00a9 Shutterstock\nFIGURE 5  DIFFERENCES BETWEEN REVAMPING AND REPOWERING AND THEIR MAIN DRIVERS  \n\u00a9 SOLARPOWER EUROPE 2019\nRevamping\nInvolves replacement of components (mainly inverters \nand modules), but without substantially changing the \nplant's nominal power.\nRepowering\nInvolves replacement of components (mainly inverters \nand modules), with causes a substantial change to the\nplant's nominal power.\nMain drivers for Revamping or Repowering\n\u2022 Aging solar assets: By the end of 2021, we expect more than 900 GWp of PV capacity installed worldwide. The fleet of \n modules and inverters is getting older which leads to an increased failure rate, higher degradation and expiring warranties.\n\u2022 Unavailability of spare parts and support: Many manufacturers of modules and inverters have left the market. This \n complicates the supply of spare parts or repair solutions and may leave an exchange of components as the only alternative.\n\u2022 Technological Improvements: The technological advancement of modules and inverters has been significant. Thus, \n exchanging components can lead to an improved performance and availability. As further benefits, new components \n offer higher design flexibility and advanced features at reduced maintenance costs. Another example is installing a battery\n storage system on an existing plant.\n\u2022 Decreasing prices: The prices for PV components have decreased substantially. This trend helps to create an \n economically feasible re-investment case.\n\u2022 Additional benefits: A repowering project usually includes additional benefits, such as new warranty terms and \n compliance with the latest regulations. Furthermore, it brings the opportunity to correct potential planning mistakes \n from the initial construction.",
        "c599457c-c29a-4173-ac7f-e6fd7052f99a": "\u2022 Module repowering should be considered as a relevant \ninterference into the electrical system.

Furthermore, an in-depth  \ncheck of the mounting structures, cables and  \nconnectors should be performed. \n\u2022 If only some of the modules are being exchanged  \nand power measurements of the old type of  \nmodules are being performed, it is recommended  \nto install the old modules according to their  \nremaining power. This means all modules in one  \nstring or connected to one MPP tracker should have \nsimilar power to reduce mismatching losses. \n\u2022 Depending on the status of the old modules (and  \nthe regulatory requirements), they can be either  \nsold to the secondary market or should be disposed \nor recycled by a professional provider. \n \n7.3.  Inverter repowering  \nAs with all electronic devices, inverters have a limited \nlifetime. With increasing age and wear, the likelihood  \nof failures and breakdowns increases. If the warranty \nof a device has expired, a technically and economically \nsuitable solution needs to be identified. Some  \nmanufacturers or service providers offer repair and  \nspare parts services. With new components it might  \neven be possible to increase the efficiency of an older \ninverter (e.g., by replacing an old control board with a  \nnew device with better performance characteristics,  \nsuch as Maximum Power Point (MPP) tracking). If an  \nidentical replacement inverter, repair services or spare \nparts are not available, using a new component  \nbecomes inevitable. There are different strategies for \ninverter repowering which should be evaluated on a  \ncase-by-case basis: \n\u2022 Partial or complete exchange: If only some of the  \ninverters are affected, a partial exchange of the  \ninverter fleet of the solar PV system can be an option. \nThis potentially reduces the overall costs, but it can \nalso increase the complexity regarding the electrical \ndesign or the implementation of two different  \ninverter types into one communication concept on-\nsite. If the repowering does not affect all inverters on-\nsite, it is advisable to store the old devices as  \npotential spare parts. Additionally, it can be practical \nto exchange more inverters than technically required \nto store those as potential exchange devices for  \nfuture defects of the old inverter type. \n\u2022 Exchange of same or different power class:  \nExchanging inverters with the same power class is \neasier for the DC and AC integration. However,  \nreplacing multiple devices through one with a larger \npower class can increase the system efficiency and \nreduce the component costs as well as future  \nmaintenance costs. \nWhen an inverter repowering is planned, several  \nfactors need to be considered: \n \nMechanical installation \n\u2022 If the new inverters have different dimensions or  \nweight, a suitable solution for the installation or  \nmounting of the inverter needs to be prepared. The \nsame applies for proper cabling if DC or AC  \nconnections are changed. \n\u2022 The manufacturer of the new device might have  \ndifferent requirements for the mounting with  \nregards to fixings, distance to other components or \nto the roof, ventilation, etc. All requirements need  \nto be checked and implemented. \n\u2022 The new inverters need to be integrated into the  \ngrounding system according to the standards and  \nthe manufacturers specifications. \n \nElectrical installation \n\u2022 The integration of the DC side to the new inverters \nneeds to follow the DC input requirements of the  \nnew inverter. The string length and the number of  \nconnected strings may need to be adjusted to suit \nthe technical parameters of maximum current and \nvoltage as well as ideal operational conditions. In  \ncase larger inverters are installed, additional DC  \ncombiner boxes might be required, and different, or \nadditional fuses may need to be integrated. \n\u2022 If different inverter sizes are installed, the  \nintegration to the AC side needs to be re-\nengineered. This includes the cable diameters,  \nprotection devices (fuses) and connectors. \n\u2022 In all cases the applicable electrotechnical rules and \nregulations need to be followed. \n \nOperation & Maintenance Best Practice Guidelines / Version 5.0 52\n7 Revamping and Repowering  /  continued",

Otherwise, an update or the \nexchange of the data logger will also be required. \n\u2022 If different inverter types are installed, it can be an  \noption to integrate the different component types \non different phases of one communication cable or \nintegrate them into one network.

When the new  \ninverter has more advanced features than the old  \none (e.g., multiple MPP tracker), this could be an  \nadditional advantage for the repowering project. \n\u2022 The noise levels of the inverters may vary, and it should \nbe adequately checked against the permitting  \nrestrictions and the neighbouring activities. \n\u2022 Depending on the status of the old inverters, they  \ncan be either kept as potential spare parts, sold to  \nthe secondary market.

General repowering considerations  \nAlthough, a repowering project is mainly technically  \ndriven, for the Owner of the solar PV system it is a  \ncommercial re-investment case. Therefore, it is of  \ngreat importance to calculate a detailed and solid  \nbusiness case before starting the project and review  \nit during the project stages. All technical and  \ncommercial data, such as historical performance,  \nfuture performance, revenues, costs, extended life  \nspan and changed maintenance requirements need  \nto be considered to come up with a prognosis of the  \nfuture income streams. With this, a classical return on \ninvestment or break-even calculation can be  \nperformed and presented to the investor as the basis \nfor a decision.  \nAs an additional analysis, calculating the sensitivities  \nof the most important factors is recommended. This  \nwill provide a better understanding of the influence of \nchanging conditions (e.g., if the costs for the project  \nwill change or the projected performance will be  \ndifferent to the assumptions). \nEach repowering activity should be approached as an \nindividual project, which can be structured as follows: \n \nPerformance analysis \n\u2022 Historical yield assessment & identification of  \nperformance issues. \n\u2022 Verification of issues on site with additional  \ninspections or testing. \n\u2022 Determination of root causes and areas for  \nimprovement.",

They are necessary for the regular operation \nof the solar PV power plant and O&M service providers \nshould always have consumables on stock and  \nmaintenance crews should carry consumables with  \nthem, together with the relevant tools. \nSpare Parts are all the items (materials and equipment \nsuch as modules or inverters) listed on the Spare Parts \nList, not in use or incorporated in the solar PV power  \nplant, intended to replace similar items in the solar PV \npower plant. \nSpare Parts Management is an inherent and  \nsubstantial part of O&M that should ensure that spare \nparts are available in a timely manner for Corrective  \nMaintenance to minimise the downtime of (part of) a \nsolar PV power plant. to the following considerations  \nhave to be made in Spare Parts Management: \n\u2022 Ownership and responsibility of insurance \n\u2022 Stocking level \n\u2022 Location of storage \na. Proximity to the plant \nb. Security \nc. Environmental conditions  \nAlthough it is best practice for the O&M service provider \nto be responsible for replenishing the spare parts stock, \nit is not necessarily responsible for the full cost of doing \nso. Some Asset Owners require O&M service providers \nto be fully responsible for the cost of all spare parts  \nwithin the O&M fee, however, the more cost-effective \napproach is to agree a set of Included Spare Parts and \nExcluded Spare Parts . Similarly, a financial limit for  \nIncluded Spare Parts can be negotiated. \nIncluded Spare Parts are those which the O&M service \nprovider is to be responsible for within the O&M fee.  \nExcluded Spare Parts are those which the Asset Owner \nis responsible for the cost of replenishing and do not  \nfall within the O&M service provider\u2019s O&M fee. This is \na flexible approach allowing the Asset Owner and O&M \nservice provider to agree which spare parts fall into  \nwhich category. It enables both parties to have a level \nof cost certainty whilst balancing this with the Asset  \nOwner's appetite for risk. The contract should contain \nprovisions on who is liable in the event that a spare  \npart is unavailable. The various parties are responsible \nfor their replenishment and bear the associated  \nproduction loss. \nOwnership of spares is often with the Asset Owner  \nfrom delivery to site or placement in the spares stock. \nIn the case of excluded spare parts, ownership  \ntransfers to the Asset Owner from the date that the  \nO&M service provider receives payment for the same.  \nMaintenance, storage, and replenishment are the  \nresponsibility of the O&M service provider. Besides  \nownership matters, it is very important to make sure,  \nupon mutual agreement, that one of the parties  \nundertakes the responsibility of insuring the spares: as \na recommendation spare parts stored on-site should  \nbe insured by the Asset Owner and spare parts stored \noff-site should be insured by the O&M service provider. \nSpare Parts Management\n8\n\u00a9 sarawuth wannasathit",

However, it is best practice for the EPC  \nand O&M service providers to have agreed upon the  \nlist. The O&M service provider should, as a best  \npractice, recommend additional spares that they  \ndeem them necessary to meet the contractual  \nobligations (e.g. availability guarantees). \nGenerally, it is not economically feasible to stock spare \nparts for every possible failure in the plant. Therefore, \nthe O&M service provider together with the Asset  \nOwner should define the stocking level of specific  \nspare parts that make economic sense (Cost-Benefit \nAnalysis). For example, if a specific part in a solar solar \nPV power plant has a frequency of failure at least of  \nonce every year or more and the loss of revenues due \nto such failure is greater than the spare part cost, it is \nimportant to have such a spare part kept available.  \nThis can also apply for parts with a long replenishment \nperiod. Similarly, one must consider the management \nrisk that a fault can cause. For example, if a  \ncomponent of a SCADA system stops working, there  \nis no resultant power loss. However, there is a risk of  \nnot being able to detect future power loss if this part  \nis not replaced. Some very large O&M service  \nproviders now propose using the spare parts in their  \ndifferent warehouses in place of, or in addition to the  \nAsset Owner\u2019s spares stock. Since they operate many \nsites, they limit the shortage of unusual spare parts by \nmaintaining a small stock. \nRegarding the stocking level, due to the very different \nconfigurations and sizes of solar solar PV power plants, \nit is very difficult to define a hard number for stocking \nspecific spare parts, however 0.2% of total module  \nquantity is often found in commercial contracts.  \nFurthermore, the regional portfolio of the O&M service \nprovider might also influence this and, as mentioned  \nabove, the determination of spare items and quantity \nis also driven by the O&M service provider\u2019s  \ncontractual commitments and guarantees. To define \nthe stocking levels of Spare Parts and Consumables,  \nthe following parameters should be taken into  \nconsideration:\n\u2022 Frequency of failure \n\u2022 Impact of failure \n\u2022 Cost of Spare Part \n\u2022 Degradation over time \n\u2022 Possibility of consignment stock with the  \nmanufacturer \n\u2022 Equipment reliability \n\u2022 Replenishment time \n\u2022 Management risk \nHowever, for any given utility scale solar solar PV  \nsystem there are certain spare parts that could be  \nconsidered as essential to have \u2013 no matter the cost.  \nTable 6 on the following page summarises a minimum \nlist. This list is not exhaustive and system  \nrequirements and technology developments can lead \nto this list being updated following discussion with  \nmanufacturers, amongst others.  \nRegarding the storage and warehousing, this should be \ndone in locations where the spare parts cannot be  \ndamaged (e.g., by humidity or high temperature  \nvariations) and are easily identifiable as being owned  \nby the Asset Owner. Additionally, the storage sites  \nshould have appropriate security measures.  \nThe decision to have either an on-site or an off-site  \nwarehouse facility or just an agreement with the  \nsuppliers to provide the spare parts, depends on many \nfactors, including the kind of part, the commercial  \nagreement, and the facilitation of the service provision. \nIf the spare parts owned by the Asset Owner are stored \noff-site, such spares should be stored separately and \nbe clearly identified as the property of the Asset Owner. \nIf the O&M service provider exchanges spare parts, an \nagreement should be drawn up with the supplier that \nensures the warranty is not voided. \nWhile proximity to the plant is a parameter that needs \nto be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, security and \nenvironmental conditions are very important as they  \ncould lead to a loss of property either through thefts  \nor damage.  \n \n \nOperation & Maintenance Best Practice Guidelines / Version 5.0 56\n8 Spare Parts Management  /  continued",

Data loggers  \nThe main purposes of a datalogger are: \n\u2022 Collecting data of relevant components (inverters, \nmeteorological data, energy meter, string  \ncombiners, status signals) with every device  \nregistered separately. \n\u2022 Basic alarm functionality (e.g., Field Communication \nissues, time critical events like AC Off). \n\u2022 Providing a temporary data backup (in case of  \nmissing internet connection). \n\u2022 Supporting the technicians during commissioning \n(e.g., checking whether all inverters work and feed-in). \nIn addition to this, some dataloggers can also provide \nthe following functions: \n\u2022 Power Plant Controller (Monitoring & Control should \nbe managed by one instance to avoid  \ncommunication issues regarding concurrent  \naccess). The Power Plant Controller can be  \nintegrated in the datalogger or can be a separate  \ndevice using the communication channel of the  \ndatalogger or even a separate one with preferential \nbandwidth. \n\u2022 Solar Energy Trading Interface (control the active  \npower by a third-party instance like energy trader). \nAs best practice, dataloggers should be selected  \nfollowing a list of criterion by the operating party as  \nlisted below. For example, an EPC service provider will \nchoose and install the data logger used to monitor the \nsite. This datalogger should be selected:  \n\u2022 For its compatibility with the inverters and auxiliary \nequipment present on site. Preference for inverter-\nagnostic dataloggers. \n\u2022 For any command functionality that may be  \nneeded (this is site type and country specific). \n\u2022 For its connectivity strength to the internet. \n\u2022 For its robustness (longevity of life and durability  \nfor the environmental conditions it will be kept in).  \n\u2022 For its cyber security measures (and those of the  \ncloud server to which it is connected), namely the  \npossibility to set up a VPN tunnel at least. \n\u2022 For its capability to store data during internet  \ncommunication outages. \nThe recording interval (also called granularity) of the  \ndatalogging should range from 1 minute to 15 minutes. \nWithin one monitoring environment granularity should \nbe uniform for all the different data collected.  \nAs a minimum requirement, data loggers should store \nat least one month of data. Historical data should be  \nbacked up constantly by sending it to external servers \nand, after every communication failure, the data  \nlogger should automatically send all pending  \ninformation. Moreover, data transmission should be  \nsecure and encrypted (see 9.9. Cybersecurity). There \nshould also be a logbook to track configuration  \nchanges (especially relevant when acting as Power  \nPlant Controller). \nAs a best practice, the data logger should store a  \nminimum of three months of data locally and a full  \ndata backup in the cloud. Moreover, the operation of  \nthe data logger itself should be monitored. This should \nbe done remotely and from an independent server,  \ndelivering information on the data loggers\u2019 operating  \nstatus at Operating System (OS) and hardware level.  \nIt should also provide alerts to the Operations room in \ncase of failures and communication loss. \nBest practice is to have dataloggers and routers  \nconstantly monitored by a watchdog device on-site. In \ncase of no response to the control unit, the power supply \nwill be interrupted by the watchdog unit, performing a \nhard reset on the stopped equipment. In cases where it \nis not possible to have an external watchdog it can be \nuseful to have an automatic reboot function. \nThe entire monitoring installation should be protected \nby an uninterruptable power supply (UPS).

More challenging to identify, are slight and  \nprogressive data deviations overtime. \nBiased KPIs lead to unnecessary operations costs  \n(unrequired on-site intervention) and performances  \nlosses, as defects may remain undetected. \nAs a best practice, the monitoring solution and system \nshould be capable of filtering these values in the most \nautomated and personalised way to cater for each  \nspecific case. \nMost effective techniques for data validation are  \nbased on the analysis of data over relatively long  \ntimespans (i.e., daily data validation), with a granularity \nbetween 1 and 15 minutes. \n \n9.3.

This it  \nis done by automatically capturing device IDs and  \nconfiguration information. This also allows for  \nautomatic detection of inverter or sensor  \nreplacement.  \n \n9.6. Interoperability \nAs a best practice, the system should ensure open  \ndata accessibility (both for sending and receiving data \nbilaterally) to enable easy transition and  \ncommunication between monitoring platforms. Table \n7 shows some examples of data integration options.  \nDue to the lack of unifying standards, every Monitoring \nSystem provider has their own method of storing and \nretrieving data. The best systems can retrieve data by \nusing open interfaces such as RESTful, providing  \ninteroperability between different systems. \nAnother important aspect of interoperability is the  \nability to aggregate data from different platforms that \nserve a range of areas in the solar PV business, such  \nas administration, accountancy, planning & on-site  \nintervention, and stock management applications.  \nThis way, information can be exploited by the central \nmonitoring platform without affecting the external  \napplications. For example, an O&M service provider  \nworks with several types of ticketing systems for  \ndifferent clients. The monitoring platform should be  \nable to collect data from all of them. Likewise,  \ninformation about tickets managed from the central  \nmonitoring system should be automatically  \ntransferable to the dedicated ticketing application. \n \n9.7. Internet connection and Local Area Network \nThe O&M service provider should make sure to provide \nthe best possible network connectivity. As a minimum \nrequirement, the bandwidth needs to be adequate  \nenough to transfer data in a regular way. \nWhenever a fibre connection is available within the  \nsolar PV-site area, this should be used to connect to  \nthe internet, with industrial routers considered as  \nstandard.

For a  \ncomprehensive overview of recommended  \nfunctionalities, refer to the Monitoring Checklist of the \nSolar Best Practices Mark.9 \n \n9.4. Data format \nThe data format of the recorded data files must  \nrespect standards such as IEC 61724 and must be  \nclearly documented. Data loggers should collect all  \ninverter alarms in accordance with original  \nmanufacturer\u2019s format so that all available information \nis obtained. \n \n9.5. Configuration \nThe configuration of the monitoring systems and data \nloggers needs to reflect the actual layout of plant  \ndetails (hardware brand, model, installation details  \nsuch as orientation, wiring losses, set up date, etc.) to \nbetter perform expected performances simulations  \nand obtain consistent insight about a plant\u2019s actual  \nstatus. If this has not been done during the plant\u2019s  \nconstruction phase, it should be done at the  \ncommissioning phase or when a new O&M service  \nprovider takes over (recommissioning of the  \nmonitoring system).  \nDuring commissioning, each single piece equipment  \nmonitored should be checked to make sure it is  \nproperly labelled in the Monitoring System. This can  \nbe done by temporarily covering insolation sensors or \nswitching off others such as string boxes or inverters. \nIt is best practice to have a Monitoring System capable \nof reading and recording all IDs from all sensors and  \nequipment it monitors.

Cybersecurity \nAs solar PV power plants have inverters and power  \nplant controllers (and monitoring systems) that are  \nconnected to the internet to enable surveillance and  \nremote instructions by operators, there are significant \ncybersecurity risks.  \nCybersecurity comprises technologies, processes and \ncontrols that are designed to protect systems,  \nnetworks, and data from cyber-attacks. Effective cyber \nsecurity reduces the risk of cyber-attacks and protects \norganisations and individuals from the unauthorised  \nexploitation of systems, networks, and technologies.10 \nCybersecurity is a vast area and multiple measures are \npossible. The following hints may help as a starting point: \n\u2022 Keep it simple: If possible, reduce the type of  \nnetwork devices to a minimum. \n\u2022 As a recommendation, traffic of the network  \ndevices may be monitored to detect abnormally  \nhigh use of bandwidth. \n\u2022 Secure physical access to the network devices and \nimplement a secure password policy. Avoid the use \nof standard passwords and change all factory  \nsetting passwords. \n\u2022 Control access from Internet via strict firewall rules:  \n\u2022 Port forwarding should not be used because this \nis a big security gap. Only router ports that are  \nnecessary should be opened. \n\u2022 Reduce remote access to the necessary use cases.  \n\u2022 The use of VPNs (Virtual Private Networks \u2013 a  \nsecure connection built up from the inside of the \nprivate network) is necessary. \n\u2022 VPN access to the site from outside is a  \nminimum requirement. \n\u2022 A VPN server or VPN service which works  \nwithout requiring a public IP on-site is preferred. \n\u2022 Each solar PV power plant should have different \npasswords. \n\u2022 Keep your documentation up to date to be sure  \nthat no device has been forgotten. \n\u2022 Use different roles to the extent possible (e.g.,  \nread only user, administration access). \n\u2022 Use professional (industrial grade) hardware;  \nonly this hardware provides the security and  \nadministration functions your plant needs to  \nbe secure. \n\u2022 Implement vulnerability management (i.e.,  \nidentifying and fixing or mitigating vulnerabilities,  \nespecially in software and firmware):  \n\u2022 Improve insecure software configurations. \n\u2022 The firmware and software of devices should be \nkept up to date. \n\u2022 Use anti-virus software if possible and keep it up \nto date. \n\u2022 Avoid wireless access if it is not necessary. \n\u2022 Audit your network with the help of external  \nexperts (penetration tests). \n\u2022 Keep your company safe: \n\u2022 Do not store passwords in plain text format, use \npassword manager (e.g., 1Password, Keepass etc.). \n\u2022 Train your employees on IT security awareness. \n\u2022 Do not share access from all plants to all  \nemployees. Give access only to those who need \nit. This way damage can be limited if an individual \nemployee is hacked. \n\u2022 Management of leaving and moving employees; \nchange passwords of plants which are overseen \nby an employee who has left the company or  \nmoved to another department. \nIt is therefore best practice that installations undertake \na cyber security analysis, starting from a risk  \nassessment (including analysis at the level of the  \nsystem architecture) and implement a cybersecurity \nmanagement system (CSMS) that incorporates a plan-\ndo-check-act cycle. The CSMS should start from a  \ncybersecurity policy, and definition of formal  \ncybersecurity roles and responsibilities, and proceed to \n10 Definition: https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/what-is-cybersecurity.",

For plants  \nin Central and Western Europe, measuring irradiance  \nwith silicon cells yields approximately 2 to 4% higher  \nlong-term PR than with a thermopile pyranometer (N. \nReich et al. 2012). \nIrradiance sensors must be placed in the least shaded \nlocation. They must be mounted and wired in  \naccordance with manufacturers\u2019 guidelines.  \nPreventive Maintenance and calibration of the sensors \nmust follow the manufacturers\u2019 guidelines. \nThe irradiance should be recorded with a granularity  \nof up to 15 minutes (minimum requirement).  \nFurther information on the categorisation of plant  \nsizes and the use of appropriate measuring  \ntechnology is provided in IEC 61724-1. \nSatellite-based Irradiance Measurements \nIn addition to irradiance sensors, complementary  \nirradiance data from a high-quality satellite-based  \ndata service can be acquired after a certain period to  \nperform comparisons with data from ground-based  \nsensors. This is especially useful in case of data loss  \nor when there is low confidence in the data measured \nonsite by the Monitoring System and it can be  \nconsidered as best practice. In particular, high-quality \nsatellite-based data should be used for irradiation  \nsensor data quality assessments. The longer the  \nperiod considered the lower the error will be for  \nsatellite-based irradiation data. For daily irradiation  \nvalues, the error is relatively high, with root-mean-\nsquare error (RMSE) values of 8 to 14% in Western  \nEurope. For monthly and annual values, it decreases  \nbelow 5 and 3%, respectively, which is in line with an  \non-site sensor (Richter et al. 2015).  \nWhen satellite-based irradiance data is used, hourly  \ngranularity or less (15 minutes if possible) is  \nrecommended. The data must be retrieved once per  \nday at least. \n \n9.10.2. Module temperature measurements \nModule temperature can be measured for  \nperformance analysis in KPIs such as the  \ntemperature-corrected PR (see 10.3.4. Temperature-\ncorrected Performance Ratio). \nThe accuracy of the temperature sensor, including  \nsignal conditioning and acquisition done by the  \nmonitoring system hardware, should be < \u00b11 \u00b0C. \nmap this onto the system architecture in terms of  \ndetailed countermeasures applied at identified points \n(e.g., via analysis of the system in terms of zones and \nconduits). These will include the use of technical  \ncountermeasures such as firewalls, encrypted  \ninterfaces, authorisation and access controls, and  \naudit/detection tools. They will also include physical and \nprocedural controls, for example, to restrict access to \nsystem components and to maintain awareness of new \nvulnerabilities affecting the system components.  \nAs a minimum requirement, data loggers should not  \nbe accessible directly from the internet or should at  \nleast be protected via a firewall. Secure and restricted \nconnection to data servers is also important. \nThe manufacturer of the datalogger and the monitoring \nplatform should provide information on penetration  \ntests for their servers, any command protocol  \nactivation channels, and the results of security audits \nfor their products. Command functions should be sent \nusing a secure VPN connection to the control device  \n(best practice). Double authentication would be an  \neven more secure option.  \nFor further information, beyond the scope of this  \ndocument, please look at the EU Cybersecurity Act (EC, \n2019) and the European Parliament\u2019s study \u201cCyber  \nSecurity Strategy for the Energy Sector\u201d (EP, 2016). \n \n9.10. Types of data collected through the monitoring \nsystem  \n9.10.1 IIrradiance measurements \nIrradiance Sensors \nSolar irradiance in the plane of the solar PV array (POA) \nis measured on-site by at least one irradiance Class A \nquality measurement device and ISO 9060:2018 (ISO \n9060 2018). The higher the quality of the pyranometer, \nthe lower the uncertainty will be. Best practice is to  \napply at least two pyranometers in the plane of the  \nsolar PV array. In case of different array orientations  \nwithin the plant, at least one pyranometer is required  \nfor each orientation. It should be ensured that the  \npyranometers are properly assigned to the different  \narrays for the calculation of PR and Expected Yield. \nClass A Pyranometers are preferred over silicon  \nreference cells because they allow a direct  \ncomparison between the measured performance of  \nthe solar PV power plant and the performance figures",
        "a329b51f-78f1-4125-85ec-4572d54894ac": "9 Data and monitoring requirements /  continued\nOperation & Maintenance Best Practice Guidelines / Version 5.0 66\nThe temperature sensor should be attached to the  \nmiddle of the backside of the module in the middle  \nof the array table, in the centre of a cell, away from  \nthe junction box with appropriate and stable  \nthermally conductive glue (Woyte et al. 2013). The  \ninstallation should be in accordance with  \nmanufacturer guidelines (e.g., respecting cabling  \ninstructions towards the data logger).  \nVarying solar PV module temperature in a plant is  \nmainly due to different wind exposure. Therefore, in  \nlarge plants more sensors will be required across the  \nsite because module temperature should be measured \nat different representative positions (e.g., for modules \nin the centre of the plant and for modules at edge  \nlocations where temperature variation is expected). \nThe granularity of module temperature data should be \nat least 15 minutes to perform a correct PR calculation. \n \n9.10.3. Local meteorological data \nIt is best practice to measure ambient temperature,  \nwind speed, rain fall and other site relevant  \nmeteorological measurement with the installation of \na local meteorological station in accordance with the \nmanufacturers\u2019 guidelines. Ambient temperature is  \nmeasured with a shielded thermometer, such as a  \nPT100. The shield protects the sensor from radiative  \nheat transfer. Wind speed is measured with an  \nanemometer, at 10m above ground level. \nWind and ambient temperature data are normally not \nrequired for calculating PR unless this is a contractual \nrequirement/agreement (e.g., according to specific  \nrecommendations such as those from the National  \nRenewable Energy Laboratory in the USA). However,  \nthey are required when the solar PV power plant is  \nmodelled in operation or retrospectively.  \nAdditionally, whenever the module temperature  \nmeasurements are not available or not suitable, wind \nspeed and ambient temperature coupled with  \ninstallation specifications can be used to retrieve a  \ngood estimation of module temperature. In this case, \n15 minutes granularity of measurement is still the  \nbest practice.  \nFor plants larger than10 MWp, having automated  \ncollection of hourly meteorological data (ambient  \ntemperature, wind speed, snow coverage, rainfall)  \nfrom independent sources is recommended. The  \nreason for this is that on-site meteorological stations \nare subject to local phenomena and installation-\nspecific results. Data from an independent weather-\nstation is less subject to this, while being also more  \nstable and robust with respect to long-term drift. They \ncan therefore be used to evaluate the quality, and  \neventually replace, the on-site measurement.  \nTherefore, for both performance assessment and  \ndetailed analysis purposes, automated, local  \nmeteorological data is recommended. However, for  \nperformance assessment the most important  \nmeasurement remains the in-plane irradiation (see 10. \nKey Performance Indicators). \nSolar resource data derived from satellite image  \nprocessing is available from several services at a  \nnominal per-site and per time-segment (such as one  \nweek) fee. The measurement error in satellite data  \nmight be greater than that of an on-site instrument  \nbut is often more reliable than a mis-aligned,  \ninadequate or dirty on-site pyranometer, and less  \nsusceptible to soiling or tampering.  \n \n9.10.4. String measurements \nIndividual string current measurements may be  \ndeployed when not supported by the inverters. String \nlevel monitoring allows for more precise trouble-\nshooting procedures than at inverter level. Depending \non the module technology used in a plant, strings can \nbe combined (in harnesses) which can help reduce  \noperation costs. \nTo detect problems quickly and to increase plant  \nuptime, installing string monitoring equipment is  \nrecommended. This will constantly measure the  \ncurrent of every string and register those  \nmeasurements in intervals of up to at 15 minutes. To  \nreduce costs, the current sensor can be used to  \nmeasure more than one string. However, no more than \ntwo strings should be measured in parallel. \n \n9.10.5. Inverter measurements \nInverters have a large set of variables that are  \nconstantly measured by their hardware, and that can \nbe registered and inv estigated from the monitoring  \nsystem. The data sent from the inverter to the  \nmonitoring system should be in cumulative values to \nallow the monitoring of the overall electricity  \ngeneration of the inverter, even in case of outages of  \nthe monitoring system.",

For ad-hoc performance analysis \npurposes such as allowing the analysis of solar PV array \nperformance, root cause analysis or possible MPP-\ntracking problems, the input DC voltage and current  \nneed to be measured and stored separately. \nIn general, and as best practice, all common inverter  \nparameters should be logged by the data loggers, since \nthere are a lot of additional important parameters, such \nas internal temperature, and isolation level, etc. that  \ncould be useful for O&M services.  \nInverters should be capable of detecting when their  \nconversion components are overheating, to protect  \nthemselves under extreme or abnormal operating  \nconditions. Therefore, it is advisable to record the  \ntemperature as provided by the inverter so that  \nventilation performance can be assessed.  \n \n9.10.6. Energy meter \nOne of the most important features of a monitoring  \nsystem is the automated collection of energy meter  \ndata with a granularity of up to 15 minutes. Gathering \nenergy meter data is required for invoicing purposes  \nbut it is also the best reference for measuring energy \nand calculating plant PR and Yield. It is also much more \naccurate than using inverter data. \nUsing a high accuracy energy meter to measure energy \nproduced and consumed by the plant is normally  \nrequired by the Utility. When this is not the case it is a \nbest practice to install a meter with a maximum  \nuncertainty of \u00b1 0.5%, especially for plants > 100 kWp. \nTo allow data acquisition via the monitoring system,  \nit is recommended to have a meter with two  \ncommunication bus ports as well as Automatic  \nMeter Reading (AMR) service from the Utility or  \nMeter Operator. \nFor meters that can store historical data it is a best  \npractice to have a Monitoring System capable of  \nretrieving historical data to avoid any production data \nloss in case of Monitoring System outages.\nRecommended variables to be monitored are: \n\u2022 Cumulative Energy generated (kWh) \n\u2022 Instant Active Power injected (kW) \n\u2022 Instant Reactive Power injected (kVAr) \n\u2022 Instant Apparent Power injected (kVA) \n\u2022 AC Voltage per each phase (V) \n\u2022 AC Current per each phase (A) \n\u2022 Power Factor / Cos Phi \n\u2022 Frequency for each phase (Hz) \n\u2022 Instant DC Power for each MPPT (kW) \n\u2022 Instant DC Current for each MPPT (A) \n\u2022 Instant DC Voltage for each MPPT (V) \n\u2022 Total instant DC Power for all MPPTs (kW) \n\u2022 Total instant DC Current for all MPPTs (A) \n\u2022 Average instant DC Voltage for all MPPTs (V) \n\u2022 Internal temperature (\u00baC) \n\u2022 Conversion components temperature (\u00baC) \n\u2022 Inverter failure signals \nIt should be noted that the precision of inverter-\nintegrated measurements is not always documented \nby the manufacturers and can be imprecise. For  \nexample, energy or AC power measurements taken by \ninverters may differ substantially from the values  \nrecorded by the energy meter. Monitoring systems  \nand reporting should specify and be transparent about \nthe devices used to acquire each measurement. \nIt is also very useful to have the monitoring system  \ncollecting data from all the inverter alarms as they are \na valuable source of information for fault detection.  \nAlso, low importance alarms or warnings can be used \nfor the organisation of maintenance activities and  \neven setting up Preventive Maintenance actions. \nIn certain cases, grid connections have limits that  \nmust be always respected, such as the maximum AC \npower that can be injected.

Whenever possible, it can also be  \nuseful to read and register the alarms generated by the \nprotection relay control unit via communication bus.\n9.11. Data collected by specialised PV module field  \ninspections  \nNot all types of data are collected automatically  \nthrough the monitoring system. Certain data are  \ncollected via on-site measurements and field  \ninspections manually or with aerial inspections.  \nsolar PV modules are engineered to produce  \nelectricity for 25-30 years and nowadays are being  \ndeployed in ever more and ever larger solar PV power  \nplants. Quality assurance is the cornerstone for long-\nterm reliability and maximising financial and energy  \nreturns. This makes tracking down the source of  \nfailures once modules have been installed vital. For  \nthat reason, field technical inspections, such as  \ninfrared (IR) thermography, electroluminescence (EL) \nimaging and I-V curve tracing, are being put into  \npractice to assess the quality and performance of  \nsolar PV modules on-site.  \nField inspections like these can be part of contractual \nPreventive Maintenance tasks or could be offered as  \nadditional services, triggered by the O&M service  \nprovider in cases where, for example, plant  \nunderperformance is not clearly understood just by  \nlooking at monitoring data. \n \n9.11.1. Infrared thermography (IR) \nInfrared (IR) thermographic data provides clear and  \nconcise indications about the status of solar PV  \nmodules and arrays and are used in both predictive  \nand corrective maintenance.  \nDepending on its temperature, every object (e.g., a  \nsolar PV module) emits varying intensities of thermal \nradiation. As explained by Max Planck\u2019s theories, this  \nradiation measurement can be exploited for the  \ndetermination of the actual temperature of objects.  \nThermal radiation \u2013 invisible to the human eye \u2013 can  \nbe measured using an infrared camera and is  \npresented in the form of a thermal image. If  \nabnormalities in solar PV modules occur, this typically \nleads to higher electrical resistance and thus a change \nin temperature of the affected module or cell. Based  \non the visual form and quantifiable temperature  \ndifferences over the thermal image of a solar PV  \nmodule, abnormalities such as hotspots, inactive  \nsubstrings or inactive modules can be identified.  \n11 The best practice checklists of the Solar Best Practices Mark are  \navailable at: www.solarbestpractices.com.",

As on-site ambient  \nconditions differ greatly from those in a standardised \nlab, the measured results should be translated into STC.. \n \n9.11.3. Electroluminescence (EL) imaging on-site \nEL images are typically taken of every module when  \nleaving the factory production line and are a very  \nuseful baseline for the health of the module before  \nleaving the factory. An EL image will show cell level  \nimperfections and cracks which are invisible to the  \nnaked eye. EL imaging can be used on-site to better  \nunderstand module quality post installation as well as \nfurther investigation following the identification of  \nanomalies by thermography.  \nDuring the EL testing a material emits light in response \nto the passage of an electric current. This is applied in \norder to It is used to check integrity of solar PV  \nmodules. Here, a current flows through the solar PV-\nactive material, and as a result, electrons and holes in \nthe semiconductor recombine. In this process the  \nelectrons release their energy as light. EL imaging  \ndetects the near infrared radiation (NIR), i.e.,  \nwavelengths between 0.75 and 1.4 \u00b5m. The EL is  \ninduced by stimulating single solar PV modules or  \nstrings with a DC current supplied by an external  \nportable power source. The NIR emissions then are  \ndetected by a silicon charge-coupled device (CCD)  \ncamera.  \nEL is usually done in a dark environment because the  \namount of NIR emitted by the solar PV modules is low \ncompared to the radiation emitted by the background \nlight and from the sun. This requires that EL imaging  \nconducted on-site has to be done during the night,  \nwhile covering the solar PV modules with a tent, or in  \na purpose-built mobile test lab. A typical setup  \nconsists of a modified single-lens reflex (SLR) camera, \na tripod, a portable DC power supply and extension  \ncables. Additionally, a high pass edge filter at 0.85 \u00b5m \nmay be used to reduce interfering light from other  \nsources. The resolution of the camera should be at  \nleast high enough so that the fingers of the solar cells \nin the module can be clearly identified. The noise of  \nthe camera output must be as low as possible (lowest \nISO number possible) and the camera should be as  \nsteady as possible in order to avoid blurry images.  \nExposure times of 15 seconds are common. \nFor thermographic data to be usable, a number of  \nminimum requirements have to be met. Irradiance  \nshall equal a minimum of 600 W/m2 and shall be  \ncontinuously measured on-site, ideally orthogonally to \nthe module surface.

See Chapter 12 for further information. \n \n9.11.4. Magnetic Field Imaging (MFI) \nMagnetic field imaging (MFI) is a new and innovative  \nmethod for quantitatively analysing flowing electric  \ncurrents non-destructively, and without contact.  \nThe underlying physics are very simple: every electric \ncurrent generates a magnetic field. A magnetic field  \nsensor creates an image of this by being moved over the \ncurrent-carrying component. Strength and direction of \nthe electric current can be inferred from this.  \nCurrent-carrying components such as solar cells,  \nmodules or batteries have a characteristic current  \ndistribution. If components have defects that  \ninfluence the electrical current distribution  \nsignificantly, the resulting magnetic field also changes. \nThese changes can be detected by MFI and thus  \ntraced back to the defects. \nThe fields of application are manifold. In solar PV, defects \nrelevant for the operation of solar modules can be  \ndetected reliably (Lauch et al, 2018; Patzold et al, 2019). \nThese are, for example, broken connectors or ribbons \n(see Figure 7), missing solder joints or defective bypass \ndiodes in the junction boxes of the modules. \nThe advantages of the measurement technique that  \nit is non-destructive, fast, and quantitative (the  \nmeasurement signal is proportional to the underlying \nelectric current). A disadvantage of using magnetic  \nfields is that the distance to the sample must be in the \nmillimeter range to produce high quality imaging  \nresults. The measurement cannot resolve  \nmicroscopic structures (< 100 \u00b5m), yet. \n \n9.11.6. Soiling measurements \nThe operational efficiency of modules is affected by  \nsoiling accumulation. Soiling limits the effective  \nirradiance and, therefore, the output of the solar PV  \nmodule. Measuring soiling I recommended as it can help \noptimise cleaning schedules and thus revenues. Several \nmethodologies exist for soiling monitoring, the most  \nbasic being human inspections. A widely used soiling  \nmeasurement method is using ground-based soiling  \nreference modules consisting of a module that remains \nsoiled, a cleaned reference cell, an automatic washing \nstation and measurement electronics. There are several \nvariations using different principles to measure the  \neffect of soiling. Digital solutions for soiling monitoring \nthat are currently under development include the  \nanalysis of satellite imagery with remote sensing  \ntechniques, machine intelligence algorithms and  \nstatistical methods. Possible soiling analyses include  \ntaking a swab of the soil to an analytical laboratory to \ndetermine its nature (diesel soot; pollen; organic soil;  \ninorganic dust) and the appropriate cleaning solution.  \n  \n \n \nFIGURE 7  EXAMPLES OF MAGNETIC FIELD IMAGING (MFI) \nSOURCE: Lauch et al, 2018; Patzold et al, 2019.  \nNOTE: Left: Schematic of 3 BB solar cell, \u201ex\u201d indicates the position of  brocken ribbon; centre: Bx magne tic field in 2D representat ion and more visual 3D on the right side.\nBroken ribbon marked position Magnetic field measurement Magnetic field measurement (3D)",

Performance ratio \nPR is a quality indicator of the solar PV power plant. As \nthe ratio between the actual Specific Yield and the  \ntheoretically possible Reference Yield, PR captures the \noverall effect of solar PV system losses when converting \nfrom a nameplate DC rating to AC output. Typically,  \nlosses result from factors such as module degradation, \ntemperature, soiling, inverter losses, transformer losses, \nand system and network downtime. The higher the PR \nis, the more energy efficient the plant is.  \nPR, as defined in this section, is usually used to report \non longer periods of time according to the O&M  \ncontract, such as month or year. Based on PR, the O&M \nservice provider can provide recommendations to the \nplant Owners on possible investments or interventions. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThese definitions are based on (Woyte et al. 2014) in  \nline with IEC 61724-1:2017 and are common practice. \nPR is measured for available times (see section 10.5.1. \nContractual Availability) at the inverter or plant level. \nNote that special attention is needed when assessing \nthe PR of overrated plants, where the output of the  \nplant is limited by the inverter\u2019s maximum AC output. \nIn such situations, and for the period that overrating  \ntakes place, PR will calculate lower than normal  \nalthough there is no technical problem with the plant. \nStakeholders should be careful assessing PR values for \noverrated plants, although the amount of overrating is \nnormally statistically constant or with negligible  \ndifferences on a yearly basis. \n \n10.3.4. Temperature-corrected performance ratio  \nIn some situations, such as a commissioning test or solar \nPV power plant handover from one O&M service provider \nto another, PR needs to be measured over a shorter  \nperiod, such as two weeks or a month. In such situations, \nusing a PR formula corrected with temperature factor is \nrecommended. This can help neutralise short-term PR \nfluctuation due to temperature variations from STC  \n(25\u00b0C). As a best practice, temperature should be  \nregistered with a granularity of up to 15 minutes  \n(referred to as period j below) and the average  \ntemperature for the time period i should be calculated \nby weighting the mean temperatures of the time periods \nj according to Specific Yield of this time period. 13\nPerformance Ratio is defined as: \n \n \nWhere: \nPR = Performance Ratio over a year (%) \nYf = Specific Yield over a year expressed in (kWh/kWp) or peak sun \nhours (h) \nYr = Reference Yield over a year expressed in (kWh/kWp) or peak sun \nhours (h) \nPR   = \u00d7 100Yr\nYf\n13 The temperature-corrected PR calculation is not consistently applied. \nTherefore, this note clarifies in brief the best practice for calculating PR using \nthe formulas provided above. There are 2 methods to apply the formula: \n\u2022 In the time-weighted method, PR is weighted over a period by the  \ntime interval. An example would be if the SCADA system provides  \ndata in 1 min / 5min / 10 min average values. PR is then calculated for  \nthat 1 min / 5min / 10 min period and the resulting PR values are then  \naveraged. This method will generally yield higher PR values in the  \nmorning, while production is low and lower PR values mid-day, but  \nwith high energy production. Therefore, low PR value are given the  \nsame with as the high PR values and the use of an average value of  \nthe PR does not take into account the different weight that PR may  \nhave over the day. This can artificially increase the PR by up to a  \ncouple of percentage points.  \n\u2022 In the irradiance-weighted method, irradiance as a sum counts higher  \nirradiance values as more impactful on the total PR for any given  \nperiod. This eliminates the weighting effect and provides a more  \naccurate PR. Therefore, all relevant measured parameters should be  \nsummed above and below the line over the calculation period before  \nany division and calculation of PR is performed.",

Therefore, the performance ratio usually \ndecreases with increasing irradiation during a  \nreporting period, even though energy production  \nincreases. This is due to an increasing solar PV module \ntemperature that results in lower efficiency. This gives \na seasonal variation, with higher PR values in the cold \nmonths and lower values in the hot months. It may  \nalso give geographic variations between systems  \ninstalled in different climates.  \nThis seasonal variation of PR can be significantly  \nreduced by calculating a temperature-corrected PR  \nto STC, which adjusts the power rating of the plant at \neach recording interval to compensate for differences \nbetween the actual solar PV module temperature and \nthe STC reference temperature of 25 \u00b0C (taking into  \naccount the temperature coefficient of the modules, \ngiven as % of power loss per \u00b0C). \n \nInterpretation of PR for overrated plants (misleading \nlower PR) \nSpecial attention is needed when assessing the PR of \noverrated plants. In these plants installed DC power is \nhigher than inverter AC power (DC/AC ratio higher than \n1), as a consequence, during sunny periods the output \nof the plant may be limited by inverter maximum AC  \noutput.

Stakeholders should be careful  \nassessing PR values for overrated plants, although the \namount of derating is normally statistically constant  \nor with negligible differences on a yearly basis. \n \nCalculation of PR using GHI instead of POA \n(misleading higher PR) \nCalculation of the PR using the Global Horizontal  \nIrradiance (GHI) instead of in-plane (POA) irradiance is \nan alternative in situations where only GHI  \nmeasurements are available. The PR calculated with  \nGHI would typically show higher values which may  \neven exceed unity.

O&M service provider KPIs \nAs opposed to power plant KPIs, which provide the  \nAsset Owner with information about the performance \nof their asset, O&M service provider KPIs assess the  \nperformance of the O&M service.  \nThe following time KPIs are illustrated in Figure 10. \n \n10.4.1. Acknowledgement time \nThe Acknowledgement Time (also called Reaction  \nTime) is the time between detecting the problem  \n(receipt of the alarm or noticing a fault) and the  \nacknowledgement of the fault by the O&M service  \nprovider by dispatching a technician. The  \nAcknowledgement Time reflects the O&M service  \nprovider\u2019s operational ability. \n \n10.4.2. Intervention time \nThe Intervention Time is the time between the  \nacknowledgment of a fault and the arrival of a service \ntechnician or a subcontractor at the plant.  \nIntervention Time assesses the capacity of the O&M  \nservice provider, andhow fast they can mobilise and  \nbe on site. It is worth noting that, in certain cases  \nremote repair is possible, or the O&M service provider \nis not able to repair the fault and third-party  \ninvolvement is necessary.\n10.4.3. Response time \nThe Response Time is the Acknowledgement Time  \nplus the Intervention time. Used for contractual  \npurposes, minimum Response Times are guaranteed \nbased on fault classes, classified on the basis of the  \nunavailable power, the consequent potential loss of  \nenergy generation, and the relevance of the failure in  \nterms of their safety impact. For recommendations  \non Response Time guarantees, see section  11.6. \nResponse Time price adjustment. \n \n10.4.4. Resolution time  \nResolution Time (or Repair Time) is the time taken to  \nresolve a fault, starting from arrival at the solar PV  \npower plant. Resolution Time is generally not  \nguaranteedas resolution often does not fully  \ncontrolled by the O&M service provider.  \n \n10.4.5. Reporting \nIt is very important for the O&M service provider to  \ncomply with reporting requirements and reporting  \ntimelines. Content and timing of the reporting is  \ngenerally agreed by the parties in the Contract  \nagreement. Content of the reporting is expected to be \nconsistent and any change in content or format needs \nto be explained by the O&M service provider.

The actual  \nhours are measured regardless of the originally  \nestimated hours of the planners. \nWhen the O&M service provider has control over the  \nequipment, the O&M service provider decides when  \nto take certain actions to preserve equipment.

O&M service provider experience \nExperience of the O&M service provider with solar PV \npower plants in a particular country, region, grid  \nenvironment and/or with solar PV power plants  \nequipped with certain technology or size can play an  \nimportant role. This is relevant for the selection of the \nO&M service provider and can be tracked by the  \nOwner over time (track record).  \n \n10.4.7. Schedule attainment \nSchedule Attainment (or Schedule Compliance) is the \nability of the O&M service provider to execute the  \nPreventive Maintenance schedule within the required \ntimeframes (typically across a period of a week or  \nmonth). \nO&M service providers who adhere to the schedule  \nensure accomplishing as much preventive  \nmaintenance and other timely corrective work as  \npossible. Schedule Attainment provides a measure of \naccountability.  \nLow Schedule Attainment can provide key warning  \nsigns to the Asset Owner regarding the O&M service  \nprovider: \n\u2022 That preventive maintenance is not done which will \nlead to equipment failures over time. \n\u2022 The O&M service provider might not have sufficient \nnumbers of qualified technical staff to  \nperformance maintenance. \n\u2022 The O&M service provider systems such as the  \nmanagement of stores and spares, procurement  \nprocesses are not effective. \n\u2022 There may be high levels of corrective maintenance \nwork \u2013 which could be due to unsolved technical  \nissues. \nBest practice requires > 90%, based on \nthe following formula: \n \n \nSchedule  \nAttainment  = \u00d7 100Total number of  \nschedules for the period\nNumber of completed  \nschedules in the period",

A complement to the technical specifications \ndetailed in the previous chapters, the contractual  \nframework described in this chapter is considered  \nbest practice.  \nWe recommend using the O&M template contract  \ndeveloped as part of the Open Solar Contracts suite of \ntemplate contracts. Formerly known as the Global  \nSolar Energy Standardisation Initiative (SESI) this is a  \njoint effort of the Terrawatt Initiative and the  \nInternational Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).  \nSolarPower Europe contributed to the drafting of the  \ntemplate O&M contract. There are a total of six  \ntemplates in a suite of contracts, designed to be used \nas a package to streamline the procurement of solar  \nprojects and make it simpler to aggregate projects  \nusing standard terms. Aside from the O&M contract,  \nthe other templates include: \n\u2022 Implementation Agreement \n\u2022 Power Purchase Agreement \n\u2022 Finance Facility Agreement term sheet \n\u2022 Supply Agreement \n\u2022 Installation Agreement \n\u2022 Asset Management Agreement \nCopies of each contract and explanatory guidance can \nbe found at the Open Solar Contracts website:  \nwww.opensolarcontracts.org. \nA common contractual framework for solar PV O&M is \nthe \u201cfixed price\u201d model for a specified scope of work that \ncan include administrative, operational, and Preventive \nMaintenance tasks. A \u201ccost plus\u201d element can then be \nadded for Corrective Maintenance or additional services. \nThe \u201ccost plus\u201d element requires, labour rates, equipment \nmarkup, overheads and profits to be negotiated in the \ncontract and added to the actual equipment costs  \nincurred in correcting unexpected problems.  \n \n11.1. Contractual Risk Allocation \nThe O&M contract is a project agreement between the \nAsset Owner and the O&M service provider for the  \npurpose of managing, operating, and maintaining the  \nsolar PV power plant. The O&M contract, together with \nthe EPC contract, is a key document in any project  \nfinance transaction. Its provisions should stem  \nfinancial risks associated with the failure of the O&M  \nservice provider to keep the solar PV power plant  \noperating properly. In general, an O&M contract should \nnminimise financial risks through appropriate  \noperational risk allocation. Financial risks posed to the \nAsset Owner from operational failures inlcude (i)  \nshortage of actual revenues in comparison with  \nexpected ones - displayed in the base case, (ii) inability \nof the Asset Owner to meet their debt service  \nobligations to the lenders, (iii) Asset Owner\u2019s liabilities \nunder other agreements with third-parties, including  \nany PPA; and ultimately, (iv) the risk of depreciation of \nthe project assets. \nAs for the EPC contracts, the Asset Owner may choose \nbetween entering into a fully wrapped O&M  \nagreement, which provides the lenders with a single  \nrecourse party for fulfilment of all obligations and  \nresponsibilities in relation to the O&M of the Plant.  \nAnother option is to have several agreements that,  \nContractual framework\n11\n\u00a9 Lipik Stock Media",

If some of the  \nO&M services are allocated to third-parties under  \ndifferent agreements, the Asset Owner should clearly \ndefine the obligations and responsibilities of each  \ncontractual party to ensure the absence of risk  \nallocation \"gaps\". \nA balance between the lenders\u2019 demands and the  \nAsset Owner\u2019s interests can be struck by aligning key \nclauses in the contract regarding timing, cost and  \nquality of the works, and market standards. In this  \nregard, the main drivers are: \n\u2022 A detailed list of Ordinary and Extraordinary  \nservices to be performed by the O&M service  \nprovider, both before and after commercial  \noperation of the project.

Penalties for \nnon-fulfilment of the performance obligations  \nshould also be included. At their most severe, this  \ncan mean termination of the O&M contract. These \nperformance guarantees are usually supported by \nBonus Schemes and backed-up by Liquidated  \nDamages (LDs). \n\u2022 Spare Parts warranties: management and availability \nof spare parts is a key aspect of minimising the  \nimpact of both scheduled and unscheduled outages \non the project's revenue stream. \n\u2022 O&M service provider\u2019s limited liability in respect of \nconsequential loss, loss of revenue, loss of profit  \nand other financial losses. \n \n11.2.

See section 11.11 \nin this Chapter which discusses how spare parts  \nmanagement may impact on the contract fee. \n \n11.4. Contractual guarantees and price adjustments \nAlthough some O&M service providers still provide PR \nguarantees, recent developments, including the  \nrecommendations of the Open Solar Contracts  \ninitiative, show that eliminating PR guarantees and  \nonly using Availability guarantees and Response Time \nprice adjustments has several advantages. \nPR is to a large extent a result of equipment choice,  \ndesign and construction, over which a (third-party)  \nO&M service provider has little influence, beyond  \nvegetation control and module cleaning. Moreover,  \nremoving PR as an O&M service provider KPI makes  \npower plant handover between EPC and O&M service \nproviders or between O&M service providers simpler. \nGenerally, the PR warranties are applied on projects  \nwhere the O&M and EPC service providers are the  \nsame company (or an affiliate). Here the O&M service \nprovider carries forward the risk of the technology  \nmade by its sister company.\nAvailability guarantees and Response Time price  \nadjustments protects Asset Owners from poor  \nperformance on the part of O&M service providers.  \nAvailability is the KPI that best reflects an O&M service \nprovider\u2019s service. Thanks to the Response Time price \nadjustment, the O&M service provider has to  \nintervene within a pre-agreed timeframe (dependant \non the fault) when events that effect plant  \nperformance are not covered by the Availability  \nguarantee. Moreover, the O&M service provider is  \nobliged to intervene during incidents that do not  \neffect performance, referring to good industry  \npractices in general. A further upside is that it makes  \nthe transition to a new O&M service provider much  \nsmoother and allows Lenders and Owners to pick a  \nservice provider based solely on of quality of services. \nAvailability guarantees and Response Time price  \nadjustments avoid burdensome change management \nprocesses resulting from the need to recalculate the  \nguaranteed PRon the event of a plant handover. \nPR warranties are no longer standard in the  \nindependent/third-party O&M market. However, it is  \npossible to set a PR target that, if not fulfilled, can trigger \na joint analysis between the Asset Owner and the O&M \nservice provider, to identify causes and agree on possible \ncorrective actions, including revamping projects.  \n \n11.5. Availability guarantee  \nA best practice is a Minimum Guaranteed Contractual \nAvailability of 98% over a year at least at inverter level. \nIn certain jurisdictions, such as in Mexico, where  \nlabour legislation and the requirements of the network \noperator stipulate the presence of full-time technical \nstaff on-site, a Minimum Guaranteed Availability of  \n99% can be provided. This should be reflected in the  \nO&M agreement\u2019s price.  \nFor contractual KPI reasons, Availability should be  \ncalculated at inverter level, on an annual basis. For more \ninformation on this, see section 10.5.1. Contractual \navailability. \nThe Availability achieved by the O&M service provider \nis translated into Bonus Schemes and LDs. For more  \ninformation on this, see section 11.7. Bonus schemes \nand liquidated damages.\n11 Contractual framework /  continued\nOperation & Maintenance Best Practice Guidelines / Version 5.0 86",

Response time price adjustment  \nThe O&M service provider should be obliged to react  \nto alarms received from the plant within a certain  \nperiod, 7 days a week. This translates in a minimum  \nguaranteed Response Time with the consequence of \nan adjustment to the contract price (the O&M fee)  \npayable to the O&M service provider in the event of  \nfailure to meet the Response Times. For a definition of \nResponse Time, see section 10.4.3. Response Time. \nWhen setting a Response Time price adjustment,  \nperiods with high and low irradiance levels, and fault  \nclasses should be differentiated. This accounts for the \n(potential) loss of energy generation capacity or  \nrelevance in terms of safety impact of the failure. \nAn example for response times according to fault  \nclasses can be seen below in Table 11. \nIn case an equipment replacement is needed, the  \nO&M service provider should commit to doing this  \nwithin 8 business hours from the end of the Response \nTime, if the spare part is included in the portfolio of  \nminimum spare parts list. If the spare part is not  \nincluded in the minimum spare parts list, the O&M  \nservice provider should commit to ordering the spare \npart within 8 business hours from the end of the  \nResponse Time and to carrying out the replacement  \nas soon as possible.  \nIn case the fault cannot be fixed by the O&M service  \nprovider and the equipment supplier's intervention is  \nrequired, the following actions are necessary:  \n\u2022 If the intervention requires spare parts beneath the \nO&M cost responsibility (see section 11.11 Spare  \nParts Management), the O&M service provider may \nproceed without separate approval (insurance  \naspects to be considered) . \n\u2022 If the costs exceed the budget limit mentioned  \nabove, the O&M service provider should  \ncommunicate the issue in writing to the Asset  \nOwner within 8 business hours from the end of the \nResponse Time. \nForce Majeure events are excluded from Response  \nTime obligations. \nIn the Open Solar Contracts O&M template, failure to  \ncomply with a Response Time guarantee by more than \nfive business days entitles an Asset Owner to  \nterminate the O&M contract. \n \n11.7. Bonus schemes and liquidated damages \nThe Availability guarantees provided by the O&M  \nservice provider can be translated into Bonus  \nSchemes and LDs. The Bonus Scheme concept is  \nreferred to in the Open Solar Contract O&M template \nas the \"Availability Bonus\". These ensure that the Asset \nOwner is compensated for losses due to lower-than-\nguaranteed Availability and that the O&M service  \nprovider is motivated to improve their service to  \nachieve higher Availability. Higher Availability usually  \nleads to higher power generation and an increase of  \nrevenues for the Owner. Hence, the Bonus Scheme  \nagreements lead to a win-win situation for both  \nparties and ensures that the O&M service provider is  \nhighly motivated. The Open Solar Contracts O&M  \ntemplate provides for a list of \"Excusable Events\".\nTABLE 11  EXAMPLES FOR FAUL T CLASSES AND CORRESPONDING MINIMUM RESPONSE TIMES\nFAUL T CLASS FAUL T CLASS DEFINITION RESPONSE TIME GUARANTEE\n Fault class 1 The entire plant is off, 100% power loss. 4 daytime hours\nFault class 2 More than 30% power loss or more than 300 kWp down. 24 hours\nFault class 3 0%-30% power loss 36 hours\nNOTE: Fault classes and the corresponding Response Time guarantees APPLIED ev en if the duration of the respective power loss is  \nless than the corresponding Response Time guarantee, pr ovided that the power loss may occur again.",

(See exclusion factors in section 10.5.1. \nContractual availability.) \nAn example for Availability Bonus Schemes and LDs  \ncan be found below: \n\u2022 Bonus Schemes: if the measured availability  \nexceeds the Minimum Guaranteed Availability, the \nadditional revenue will be divided between the  \nAsset Owner and the O&M service provider per  \npreviously agreed shares. In this case additional  \nrevenue should be calculated against the expected \nannual revenue in the base case scenario. Targets  \nfor overall plant production constitute minimum  \nthresholds for bonuses. \n\u2022 Liquidated Damages: if the Minimum Guaranteed  \nAvailability is less than the measured availability, all \nthe revenue lost due to the availability shortfall should \nbe reimbursed to the Asset Owner by the O&M  \nservice provider. In this case revenue lost should be \ncalculated against the expected annual revenue in \nthe base case scenario. This is usually invoiced by the \nAsset Owner to the O&M service provider. \n\u2022 Bonuses can be offset against LDs and vice versa. \n\u2022 The amount of yearly LDs should be capped at  \n100% of the O&M annual fee. Reaching this cap  \nusually results in termination rights for the Asset  \nOwner and the O&M service provider. In the Open  \nSolar Contracts O&M template, the right is only  \ngiven to the Asset Owner. \n \n11.8. Service standards \nThe O&M service provider must act in accordance  \nwith all laws, authorisations, good industry practice,  \nplanning consents, manufacturer's warranties and  \noperating manuals, and to the standard of a  \nreasonable and prudent operator. Compliance with  \nadequate H&S standards, is also a critical requirement \nand expectation within the standard of the services.  \nThe Asset Owner should be entitled to instruct a third-\nparty to provide any services that the O&M service  \nprovider cannot at the O&M service provider\u2019s cost.  \nThis entitlement should only be triggered if the O&M  \nservice provider fails to follow a corrective  \nmaintenance programme. \n11.9. O&M service providers\u2019 qualification \nThe O&M service provider must have the means, skills \nand capabilities to operate and maintain the plant in  \naccordance with the contractual obligations.  \nExperience and professionalism, H&S capabilities,  \nskilled teams, and access to spare parts are criteria for \nthe selection of the O&M service provider. As O&M  \nservices are a combination of remote operations  \nservices and local maintenance activities, the Asset  \nOwner should make sure that both components are  \nwell managed and interfaces between the two are well \ndefined. This is especially important should the O&M  \nservice provider subcontract any aspect of the work,  \nas each entity will need to be held accountable for the \noverall O&M performance. \n \n11.10. Responsibility and accountability \nThe responsibility of the O&M service provider is  \nusually defined in the Scope of work, which forms a  \npart of the O&M contract. In the Open Solar Contract  \nO&M template, this is set out in the O&M Services  \nSchedule. A detailed description of the O&M scope  \nitems ensure clarity on what the O&M service provider \nwill do during the term of the contract. In addition to  \nthe Scope of work, the Annual Maintenance Plan  \n(AMP) and Annual Maintenance Schedule (AMS)  \n(please refer to attachment \u201cAnnual Maintenance  \nPlan\u201d) outline the granularity and frequency of  \n(predominantly) Preventive Maintenance works. The  \nexecution of the activities should be regularly reported \nto the Asset Owner\u2013 this forms the minimum  \nrequirements. Best practice in reporting is to compare \nthe executed activities with the AMP and AMS, and  \noutlines deviations and reasoning. \nCorrective Maintenance activities performed in cases \nof component failure or energy generation shortfall,  \nare controlled by performance commitments signed  \nby the O&M service provider. In the Open Solar  \nContracts O&M template, these are set out as  \n\"Corrective Maintenance Services\". \nMoreover, the Availability Guarantee and Response  \nTime price adjustment explained in section 11.4. \nContractual Guarantees and price adjustments of the \npresent chapter also represent a level of  \naccountability for the O&M service provider.\n11 Contractual framework /  continued\nOperation & Maintenance Best Practice Guidelines / Version 5.0 88",

Therefore, solar PV  \npower plant security should be ensured by specialised \nsecurity service providers, directly contracted by the  \nAsset Owner or, exceptionally, subcontracted by the  \nO&M service provider. The security service provider  \nshould also assume liability for the services provided. \nFor more information on this, see section 5.8. Power \nplant security. \n \n11.11. Spare parts management \nThe Open Solar Contracts O&M template takes two  \napproaches to Spare Parts management. Either the  \nO&M service provider takes full responsibility for  \nSpare Parts or there is a distinction between \"Included \nSpare Parts\" (included in the O&M service provider\u2019s  \nfee), and \"Excluded Spare Parts\" (payable in addition  \nto the O&M service provider\u2019s fee within a pre-agreed \nmargin). In either case, replenishing Spare Parts stock \nwill be the O&M service provider\u2019s responsibility,  \nalthough at the Asset Owner's cost in relation to  \nExcluded Spare Parts. This guidance considers it best \npractice to take the second approach of clearly  \nidentifying Included and Excluded Spare Parts, in order \nto find an appropriate balance between the amount  \nof risk that the Asset Owner is willing to accept against \nthe cost of the O&M fee.  \nThere should be a component, materials, and spare  \nparts defects warranty for 12 months from the date  \nof installation, which should continue to apply even  \nafter expiry or termination of the O&M contract.  \nFor more information on Spare Parts Management,  \nsee the Chapter 8. Spare Parts Management.\n11.12. Power plant monitoring \nThe O&M service provider should operate and  \nmaintain the metering system according to local  \nregulations and norms. In some countries there are  \ntwo metering systems: one that measures power  \ninjection in the grid, owned and operated by the grid  \noperator, and one that measures power production,  \nowned by the Asset Owner and operated by the O&M \nservice provider. \nThe O&M service provider will also make sure that  \nperformance monitoring and reporting is operated  \nand maintained according to the monitoring  \nspecifications and best practices (see 9. Data and  \nmonitoring requirements). \nThe Asset Owner has the right to carry out the  \nverification of the metering system to evaluate and  \ncontrol the exactness of the measured data. \n \n11.13. Reporting \nReporting should be done periodically, as contractually \nagreed between the O&M service provider (the  \nTechnical Asset Manager) and the Asset Owner. The  \nAsset Owner should have the right to contest the  \nreport within a certain timeframe. \nFor more information on industry best practices  \nregarding reporting, see section 4.1.

        "bb1142ce-4b4f-47ac-a731-5c4c391eceb6": "Innovations  \nand trends\n12\nO&M service providers are under increasing pressure \nto do more with less. Increasing human resource  \nefficiency through the use of data-driven and Industry \n4.0 techniques are key themes for O&M as the  \nindustry works to reduce the number of human  \ninterventions and embraces digitisation. \nThe following chapter lists important technology areas \nbeing developed by several innovative industry service \nproviders. Many of these new technologies are  \nbecoming close to mainstream adoption, others are in \nearly-stage development. \n \n12.1. Aerial Electroluminescence \nPurpose and description \nTo gain a deeper understanding of the nature and root \ncause of defects identified through thermography, or \nto understand the overall health of a large number of  \nmodules on a solar plant, EL imaging is often used  \n(see Chapter 9.11.3 .). Typically limited by logistical  \ncomplexity and cost, the ability to deliver EL imaging  \nat volume and economically is often a barrier to the  \nwider adoption of this type of test. However, in recent \nyears, advances in the technology used to control the \nrequired current applied to the module (often  \nreferred to as \u2018back powering\u2019), aerial camera  \ntechnology and AI for image processing are resulting  \nin early-stage commercialisation of high volume EL  \ntesting using drones. \nState of play \nAerial EL needs to be conducted at night. Modules  \nmust also be back powered to allow them to emit the \nlight required for EL image capture. Key to benefiting \nfrom the drone-based approach is being able to back  \npower enough modules at a given time to enable the  \ndrone to collect images quickly and at high volume.  \nBack powering is typically provided by the use of  \ngenerators meaning there will be limitations on the  \nnumber of modules that can be back powered at the  \nsame time. Advances in switching consoles to control \nthe back powering as the drone passes over a given  \narea, and the development of inverters capable of  \nswitching to back power mode, are helping address  \nthis particular challenge.  \nThe main difficulty with aerial EL image collection is  \nobtaining adequate image quality to enable the useful \nanalysis and identification of subtle defects and  \ncracks. Also, depending on the onward use of the  \nimages, if you were to pursue a manufacturer warranty \nclaim, poor quality images would be rejected by the  \nmanufacturer. There are several parameters that are  \nkey to producing a quality image: a consistent and low \nflight path over the module table for the drone; camera \nstability; and consistent back powering levels.  \nCurrently, these factors ar e difficult to fully control  \nwith the existing technology. Advanced drone sensors \nare being developed which will help maintain a safe  \nand consistent low height above a target surface. This \ntechnology, when mature, could be used to control a  \nlow flight path over a module table, irrespective of the \nsolar plant topographical profile. \n\u00a9 BayWa r.e. renewable energy GmbH\nOperation & Maintenance Best Practice Guidelines / Version 5.0 90",
        "45f24df5-e4c7-4001-b6f3-fc9c73a18413": "Operation & Maintenance Best Practice Guidelines / Version 5.0 91\nOnce good images have been collected, the next  \nchallenge is processing at high volume. This requires  \naccurate segmentation, localisation, and identification \nof defects within the module and their consistent  \nclassification. Computer vision and AI have been  \nsuccessfully used to process IR images, but there are \nsignificant challenges with applying similar  \ntechniques to EL images. The defects that need to be \nidentified in EL images are much more subtle and  \nvaried in nature. Training a neural network to reliably  \nand accurately process these images requires a  \nsignificant volume of training data, covering the many \npermutations of module types.  \nIt is expected that many of the challenges outlined  \nabove will be overcome within the next 5 years and  \nthat aerial EL will become more common place and  \ncost competitive in the industry. However, at present \nthis technique remains more expensive than aerial  \nthermography, meaning it is used predominantly as a \nsecondary inspection technique for inaccessible roof \narrays and targeted follow up testing ahead of a  \nwarranty claim. \n \n12.2. UV Fluorescence imaging \nPurpose and description \nUV-Fluorescence imaging is a non-destructive  \nimaging technique for failure analysis of solar PV-\nmodules. The development of the technique started  \naround 2010 with first publications in 2012 (K\u00f6ngtes  \net al, 2012; Schlothauer et al, 2012; Eder et al, 2017;  \nMuehleisen et al, 2018). UV-Fluorescence  \nmeasurements must be performed in a dark  \nenvironment (typically at night) by illuminating the  \nsolar PV-modules with UV-light (<400nm). Most  \nencapsulants show fluorescence in the visible region \nand thus the material\u2019s response can be captured with \na photographic camera. Modules do not need to be  \ndisconnected or powered during this procedure.  \nThe observed fluorescence of the encapsulation  \nabove the cells with respect to (i) spatial distribution, \n(ii) intensity and (iii) spectral shift of the fluorescent  \nlight is dependent on operation time in the field,  \nclimatic conditions, and the type of encapsulant and  \nbacksheet used. Furthermore, the fluorescence signal \ndepends on the type of defect (micro cracks in c-Si  \ncells, hotspots, or glass breakage). \nImaging of solar PV modules typically takes less than  \n60 seconds. An example of UV-fluorescence is given  \nin Figure 12. The advantages of the technique are that \nno modifications are necessary to the solar PV  \nsystems and, when used in combination with EL, an  \nevaluation of timelines for various instances of  \ndamage becomes possible as the fluorescence signal \nis a function of time. New cracks for instance are only \nvisible in EL because there was no time to \u201cbleach\u201d the \nfluorescence signal. \nFIGURE 12  EXAMPLE UV-FLUORESCENCE IMAGES AFTER A SEVERE HAILSTORM\nSOURCE: Taken from W. Muehleisen (2018).",
        "ed5cc943-7977-4744-9669-c55873a76329": "State of Play \nThere are several things to consider when performing \ndrone-based UV Fluorescence (UVF) Imaging  \ninspections. The cost of drones and trained pilots can \nbe a prohibitive factor in using UVF technology.  \nSimilarly, conditions must be stable enough to take  \nimages in the dark with a 0.1 second exposure time  \nand the drone needs to be powerful enough to support \nthe extra weight of a camera and a UV lamp.  \nA minimum of two trained people are required for a  \nUVF inspection, one being the pilot and the other being \nthe photographer. The extra weight of the camera and \nthe UV lamp on the drone means that batteries drain  \nquicker and poses limits on inspections. These  \nconstraints are increased further by the UV lamp  \ndrawing power from the battery as well. This means  \nthat a 4.5 Ah battery can provide a flight time of 8-10 \nminutes. Moreover, the drone\u2019s flight path must be  \nrelatively low to be able to capture quality images. \nEstimates predict that it is possible to inspect 720  \nmodules per hour (including time for six battery  \nchanges) if conditions are perfect. However, there are \nseveral other factors that can affect inspection time, \nsuch as project design and weather conditions. To be \nmost effective UVF inspections must be done in the  \ndark and in calm conditions, both of which are far from \nguaranteed. Working in the dark risks damage to the  \ndrone from increased operating difficulty, secondly  \nfinding staff willing to work at night comes with added \ncosts to the project (paying overtime or taking on  \nmore staff). Moreover, new modules with UVA  \ntransparent EVA technology reduce the effectiveness \nof drone based UVF inspection. Despite these  \ndrawbacks, using drones to perform UVF inspections \ncan save time, particularly when inspecting rooftop  \ninstallations as staff do not need to get up onto rooves.  \nAs this technology is still emerging, many O&M service \nproviders lack the in-house expertise to interpret the  \nfindings of UVF inspections. This adds an extra layer  \nof cost to the process and has prevented the  \ntechnology being mainstreamed for solar PV power  \nplant inspection. \n \n \n \n \n12.3. Automated plant performance diagnosis \nPurpose and description \nPlant performance assessment is typically executed  \nusing a top-down approach, analysing low performing \nobjects by drilling down from substations, and  \ninverters to junction boxes and strings. This process is \ntime consuming and expert dependent. Furthermore, \nthe process does not guarantee revealing all  \nunderperformance issues.  \nAutomated bottom-up diagnosis using advanced big  \ndata mining techniques can overcome the  \ndisadvantages of classic plant performance  \nassessment by experts, namely, the difficulty of  \nexpertly handing data, and the likelihood or error in  \nperformance diagnosis. \nHowever, there are some key disadvantages to  \nautomated plant performance diagnosis. The principal \ndrawback is around scaling up the use of the  \ntechnology. Currently it is very expensive to  \nimplement. This would not be an issue if the  \ntechnology could be applied across a portfolio of solar \nPV power plants. However, there is a lack of uniformity \namongst SCADA systems, meaning that information  \nand learning are difficult to transfer between sites.  \nCoupled with this, the current lack of in-house  \nexpertise in O&M companies means external service  \nproviders would be required to implement the system, \ndriving up costs.

Predictive Maintenance for optimised hardware \nreplacement \nPurpose and description \nPreventive Maintenance occurs periodically according \nto contractually agreed schedules and based on  \nexpert knowledge. In addition, Preventive Maintenance \nmay be scheduled when the operator identifies an  \nunexpected deviation in performance through the  \nmonitoring system. Different maintenance  \noptimisation models are employed to find the optimal \ncost to benefit balance between maintenance  \ninterventions. These models count on the probability  \nof failure of each component of the solar PV system  \nand the impact of that failure on the entire system. For \nexample, the actual lifetime of solar PV inverters under \ndifferent operating conditions is still uncertain. In  \npractice, inverters will not fail in a predictable way,  \nafter a certain period of time, as usually modelled in  \nbusiness plans. Moreover, failure-based maintenance \ni.e., replacing inverters as they fail may not be the most \nefficient solution.   \nA good predictive monitoring system could help with \nassessing the optimal hardware replacement cycle by \nmodelling the uncertainty in the time-to-failure with  \na known probability distribution function.  \nMaintenance optimisation models use the output of  \nroot cause analyses and remaining useful lifetime  \nanalyses to predict future asset failures. This can be  \nused to optimise planning of maintenance and related \nresource allocation. \nBig data analytics can bring added value at any stage of \nO&M objectives: analysis from observation of collected \ninformation, fault detection, fault diagnosis, and  \noptimisation through recommendations issued from \nthe advanced monitoring system. Today different  \napproaches are proposed. Whereas classic Artificial  \nIntelligence (AI) proposes an advanced diagnostic  \nthrough knowledge-based models, unsupervised and \nsupervised learning methods offer different  \napproaches (e.g., neural networks) using statistics.  \nThe advantages of these Predictive Maintenance  \noptimisation models are that they lower the cost of  \nmaintenance by scheduling it more effectively. The  \ndiagnostic element of the models also helps to  \nreduce plant downtime. However, the methods are  \nsensitive to device models and brands, making them  \nhard to generalise. \n \nState of play \nToday, no model has been proven to be completely  \nreliable. Big-data analysis allows easy recognition of a \nfault and, in some cases, provides a clear diagnosis  \nand recommendations on the short-term actions to  \ntake to avoid probable upcoming issues.

Augmented Reality, Smart Glasses \nPurpose and Description \nVirtual or augmented reality refers to digital elements \nof interactions using cameras on e.g. smartphones,  \ntablets, or special devices such as smart glasses.  \nSpecifically, virtual reality is a computer-generated  \nsimulation of a three-dimensional environment that  \ncan be interacted with by a person using special  \nelectronic equipment. Augmented reality refers to an \nenhanced version of the real world achieved through  \nusing digital elements. For the sake of simplification,  \nthe term augmented reality is used in the following  \nreferring to the use of smart glasses in O&M. \nO&M service providers and their operations teams face \nthe recurring challenge of working with a considerable \nvariety of hardware and software from different  \nmanufacturers at various sites (at sometimes remote \nlocations). This heterogeneity requires broad  \nknowledge, skill transfer, and good cross-departmental \ncommunication. New technologies based on  \naugmented reality can support O&M service providers \nwith these challenges by easing the collaboration  \nbetween offices and field engineers. \nCorresponding software applications combined with  \nsmart glasses enable users to interact visually and  \nacoustically to support works on site. The field  \nengineer using the smart glasses is connected to a  \nsupervising (desktop) user who will be able to guide  \nthem through working steps, using the desktop  \nversion of the respective software. The smart glasses \nuser is connected to the supervisory user via an  \nintegrated headset. Visually, conditions on site are  \nrecorded by an integrated camera. The recordings are \nthen displayed live for the supervisory user who can  \nadd explanatory diagrams, screenshots, comments,  \netc. These additions are then displayed on the lens of \nthe smart glasses. This ensures secure working in line \nwith common H&S requirements (hands free) while  \nthe field engineer is guided through working  \nprocedures. Furthermore, holograms can be used to  \nenable access to animated maintenance instructions.  \n \nState of play \nSmart glasses and corresponding software solutions  \nare becoming more popular in the O&M segment.  \nDecreasing price levels for O&M services require  \nimproved service/cost efficiency. Augmented reality  \ncan support O&M service providers\u2018 operations by  \neasing skills and information transfer and ad hoc  \nsolutions which can positively affect service  \nefficiency. \n12 Innovations and trends /  continued\nOperation & Maintenance Best Practice Guidelines / Version 5.0 94\nFIGURE 14  PREDICTIVE MAINTENANCE FOR OPTIMISED HARDWARE REPLACEMENT\nYear\nOptimal replacement\ncycle for predictive\nmaintenance\nReplacement rate (4%)\n4.0%\n3.0%\n2.0%\n1.0%\n0.0%\n1234567\nCost per time unit under \nthe optimal age-based\nreplacement policy\nYear?\nWhen is the right time \nto replace an inverter?\nSource: ACHIM WOYTE, 3E",

A stable internet  \nconnection is required to maintain contact between  \nthe field engineer and the supervisor. This can be  \nproblematic for solar PV power plants in more  \nremote locations. At present the technology is also  \nexpensive. However, as it becomes more  \nmainstreamed, cost competitiveness should  \nimprove. \n \n12.6. Internet of Things (IoT) and auto-configuration \nPurpose and description \nInternet of Things (IoT) in solar PV systems represents \nan interoperability environment where all devices in  \nthe field are connected to each other and show  \nthemselves as available to be connected to the  \nsystem. This can improve integrated, secure  \ncommunication and efficiency. Each connecting  \ndevice should provide the following information: \n\u2022 Device parameters (brand, type, Serial Number, \ninternal datasheet specifications). \n\u2022 Device status and conditions (operational status, \ntemperature, etc.). \n\u2022 Connection with other devices & mapping (strings \nconnected, inverter, sensor position, etc.). \n\u2022 Any other relevant information. \nStandardisation efforts (e.g., SunSpec Alliance\u2019s  \nOrange Button initiative) are taking place throughout  \nthe solar PV market and will help to improve on  \nconfiguration costs for solar monitoring. However, the \nsolar monitoring industry will also benefit heavily  \nfrom the emerging Internet-of-things technologies  \nthat further improve plug-and-play behaviour of  \ndevice communication, improve the quality and the  \nsecurity of the communication, and reduce the cost  \nof hardware.\nState of play \nThere are several advantages to this technology.  \nPrincipally, it can reduce the costs of monitoring  \nhardware and infrastructure. Similarly, it eases the  \nconfiguration and maintenance of monitoring systems, \nwhilst improving the quality and stability of data. It also \nprovides for improved secure communications. \nHowever, there is a risk that existing hardware and  \nmonitoring equipment will not be compatible with the \nnew technology, resulting in expensive hybrid  \nsolutions until it becomes more mainstreamed. \nMany Internet-of-Things (IoT) technologies have  \npassed the prototype phase and are available for  \nmassive deployment. However, many different  \ntechnological solutions and approaches are still  \navailable in the market and no final best practice  \napproach has emerged.  \nAgain, this leads to a standardisation issue for  \nindustry-wide adoption of Internet-of-Things  \ntechnology within the solar industry and as such  \nbenefits from its advantages will be reduced when  \nconsidering solar PV on a larger scale. \n \n12.7. PV Monitoring-Imagery Data fusion \nPurpose and description \nCurrent solar PV monitoring solutions track key  \nparameters of solar PV assets (e.g., energy production, \nirradiance, performance ratios, etc.), with high  \ntemporal resolution (e.g., up to 1-10 minutes) and  \ntrigger alarms when deviations form expected  \nperformance occur. However, there are no specific  \noptimisation objectives linked to detection of  \nunderperformance. This method, which relies solely  \non solar PV monitoring data, presents two significant  \nintrinsic limitations: \n\u2022 Expert-dependence: As such, a misconfiguration \nof (manually defined) expected performance \ndata often leads to misdetection (or \nmisinterpretation) of deviations from the \nmonitored performance data (i.e., false \nnegatives/positives). \n\u2022 Insufficient spatial granularity: solar PV \nmonitoring data alone is insufficient for \nidentifying the root-causes and locations of \nenergy losses within solar PV systems, as their \nbest spatial resolution is typically down to string",
        "bde035c5-6cb9-4eaf-9ca9-e690383bc164": "level (i.e., 10-30 solar PV modules combined). As \na result, several underperformance issues \u2013 \nespecially at solar PV array, module, and \nsubmodule level \u2013 may remain undetected or \nunidentified. \nCurrently, root cause analysis at higher granularity is  \ncarried out through various aerial imaging inspection  \ntechniques, some of which are described earlier in the \nchapter). Although these methods have impressive  \ntime-efficiency and spatial resolution of aerial  \nimagery data analytics (inspection rates of several  \nMW/hour; detection down to submodule/cell level),  \nthere are also considerable drawbacks: \n\u2022 Practically inexistent temporal granularity: Aerial \nimagery inspections/scans of solar PV power \nplants are carried out per-schedule (e.g., bi-\nannually), rather than as part of preventive \nmaintenance. This means they can, at best, only \noffer a qualitative \u201cinstant picture\u201d of the \ncondition of a solar PV power plant and its \ncomponents. \n\u2022 Decoupled from solar PV monitoring: There is no \nreal-time communication or correlation with \ncrucial solar PV monitoring data (inverter \noutputs, PR, weather data, etc.), preventing \nprecise determination of the causes of \nunderperformance and power losses with image \ndata (fault) signatures. \nFrom this perspective, enabling fusion (and  \ninteroperability) between heterogeneous solar PV  \nmonitoring and imagery data/sensors, will be a key  \nfunctionality and differentiator for next generation  \n\u201cintegrated\u201d solar PV monitoring solutions. Indeed, this \nconcept offers key advantages: i) solar PV performance \nmonitoring data becomes more actionable, leveraging \nthe diagnostic capacity and accuracy of image data  \nwith high spatial granularity; ii) the solar PV imagery  \ndata gain a temporal and quantitative dimension, being \ncoupled and correlated with real-time monitoring data \nand power gain/loss analytics.  \nOther innovation pathways towards solar PV  \nmonitoring-image data fusion solutions can include  \ntheir interfacing with solar PV digital twins, for example, \nor the integration of BIM and GIS data, and the  \nreplacement of (aerial) IR image data by hyperspectral \nor multispectral image data of solar PV power plants. \n \nState of play \nSeveral commercial solutions of advanced solar PV  \nmonitoring exist, offering software-driven  \nquantification and classification of string/inverter-\nlevel failures, data analytics for soiling rates and  \nperformance degradation, and weather and energy  \nflow analytics. On the other hand, turnkey commercial \naerial-IR imagery services offer AI-based data  \nanalytics, fault diagnostics and reporting, as well as  \nrecommendations for corrective maintenance  \nactions. Yet, in practice, solar PV monitoring platforms \nare decoupled from IR imagery diagnostics and not  \noptimally aligned in today's solar PV O&M.  \nConcepts towards aggregation and fusion of solar PV \nmonitoring and inspection/imagery data are under  \ndevelopment and being patented, in ongoing  \ninternational R&D projects. The aim is to gain validation \nby 2024. Over the last 5 years, there have been efforts \nand patented methodologies that couple solar PV  \nmonitoring and/or IR imaging data with physics-based \nsolar PV yield simulations and loss analytics. \n \n \n \n12 Innovations and trends /  continued\nOperation & Maintenance Best Practice Guidelines / Version 5.0 96",

It also \nhighlights where rooftop solar projects are distinctively \ndifferent from utility-scale projects, and where they may \nrequire specific O&M best practices that may not be  \npresent or applicable for utility-scale projects.  \nA rooftop solar PV system has its electricity-\ngenerating solar panels mounted on the rooftop of a  \nresidential or commercial building or structure. On  \nresidential buildings they have typically a power of  \nabout 5 to 20 kWp, while those mounted on  \ncommercial buildings often reach 100 kWp to 1 MWp. \nLarge rooves can house industrial scale solar PV  \nsystems in the range of 1-10 MWp. Since O&M  \norganisation depends on size and structure of the  \nasset we distinguish between:: \n\u2022 C&I (commercial and industrial) rooftop solar and, \n\u2022 Huge portfolios of residential systems \n(distributed solar portfolios). \n \n13.1. C&I Rooftop Solar \nC&I rooftop solar systems are designed and installed  \nfor commercial or industrial applications. They are  \neither built, owned, and operated by an IPP who then  \nsells electricity to a company or institution via a PPA,  \nor ownership is transferred to a company or institution \nby an IPP which continues to operate the installation.  \nIn addition, a growing trend observed internationally in \nenergy-intensive built-up urban areas with high-rise  \nresidential, commercial, or mixed-use blocks, is for  \nrooftop solar systems that either feed into the grid or \nare set up as distributed generation.  \nC&I rooftop solar systems frequently occur in what is \nknown as a \u201cdistributed generation\u201d setup. Distributed \ngeneration refers to energy-generating technologies,  \nincluding solar solar PV, that are sited either on or nearby \nthe premises that are consuming that energy generated. \nSometimes distributed generation energy systems are \npart of a microgrid that offers a degree of crucial power \nindependence from the main grid in cases such as mains \nelectricity outages during extreme climate events. C&I \ndistributed generation is being paired increasingly with \non-site energy storage solutions to enhance energy  \nindependence and efficiency for the site. \nDue to the relatively significant size of C&I rooftop  \nsystems (500kWp-10 MWp), the best practices  \nhighlighted elsewhere in these Guidelines should be  \napplied to these installations. However, their location  \non rooves and their situation in commercial/industrial \nenvironments require additional guidelines to address \nthese factors. \nRegarding H&S considerations for C&I rooftop solar, the \nnecessary precautions outlined in Chapter 2. Health, \nSafety, Security, and Environment should be taken into \naccount, but need to be complemented to address the \ndangers associated with working at height (see for  \nexample Best practice guidelines for working at height \nin New Zealand, HSA Guide to the Safety, Health and  \nWelfare at Work or IACS Guidelines for Working at  \nHeight). These additional precautions include: \n\u2022 Presence of permanent guardrails or other forms  \nof edge protection \n\u2022 Presence of maintenance corridors \n\u2022 Use of mobile elevating work platforms, forklift  \nplatforms, etc.",

They can  \nprovide image data that can identify anomalies  \nmissed by ground monitoring equipment. This allows \nproblems to be spotted and rectified in a proactive,  \ntime- and cost-efficient manner, reducing the  \nlikelihood of more serious issues further down the line. \nTo accurately calculate the Energy Performance Index, \ncollection of Reference Yield (Local Irradiation) and  \ntemperature data is required. \nTable 12 shows the different methods that can be  \napplied for collection of reference yield. \nThe variety of conditions leads to a higher incidence  \nof uncertainty: greater shade, lower data accuracy,  \nlower comparability between assets.  \nFor example, greater and more variable shade profiles, \ndue to significant roof obstacles, require that  \nexpected yields used in the EPI are adjusted based on \nshade expectation for the KPI interval. \nAs shading and vegetation control tend to be an  \nongoing problem for smaller-scale C&I given their  \n\u2022 Use of safety mesh \n\u2022 Use of temporary work platforms (also to avoid  \ndamage of modules) \n\u2022 Marking of dangerous areas (for example, fragile  \nroof material) \n\u2022 Correct use of harness systems and lifelines \n\u2022 Correct use of ladders \nAs a best practice, aerial inspections should be  \nconducted with drones as they can safely and  \naccurately capture visual and thermographic data in  \nsignificantly less time than it takes to manually  \ninspect the entire array.

Distributed Residential Solar Portfolios \nDistributed solar portfolios refer to portfolios  \ncomprising multiple, small assets installed on  \nresidential rooftops.  \nOwnership of assets varies from country to country  \nand is based on the bilateral agreement between the  \nconstructor/ operator and the roof owner. Generally,  \nthere are three kinds of owners: \n1. Homeowners that own the installations on their \nhomes  \n2. Third-party companies that own the installations \nand usually lease the rooftop or sell the electricity \nproduced to the owner of the rooftop at a \ndiscounted price from the one offered by utilities \none  \n3. Local councils or private and social housing \nassociations that have equipped their properties \nwith solar panels  \nHomeowners that own the installations on their  \nhomes have paid for the installation themselves and  \nusually have a bilateral net- metering agreement with \nthe local utility for the energy produced. \nIn the case of third parties that have paid for the  \ninstallation themselves, they usually undertake the  \nmaintenance as well. The financial model depends on \nthe bilateral agreement between themselves and the \nrooftop owners. Common practices include leasing  \nthe rooftop area and taking advantage of all the  \ngenerated power, or selling the power produced at a  \ndiscounted price to the rooftop owner. \nApart from the general aspects of rooftop solar  \nsystems, main challenges of large distributed solar  \nportfolios are: \n\u2022 The multitude of assets: portfolios of 10,000+ \ninstallations are common. \n\u2022 The variety of conditions (for example, shading, \ninclination, orientation, etc.). \n\u2022 The variety of equipment used: multiple inverter \nbrands (including monitoring systems) and panels. \n\u2022 The common presence of stakeholders who are \nnot solar professionals. \n\u2022 Getting access to the house for maintenance \nactivities requires making appointments with the \ntenants. \n \n13.2.1. Operations \nSince physical site inspections and callouts at multiple \nsites mean higher costs, it is economically cheaper to \ninvest into monitoring hardware (temperature /  \nirradiance) on top of inverter monitoring, and  \nimplement automatic root cause analyses, where this \nis possible. Therefore, monitoring equipment  \naccounts for a greater percentage of the total  \ninvestment. \nFor large portfolios of small installations extra  \nmonitoring hardware might be too expensive.  \nAutomated analysis methodologies comparing  \nneighbouring installations can be used in combination \nwith irradiation data coming from meteorological  \nstations and satellites, or theoretical clear-sky  \nirradiation data.",

The level is dependent \non local legislation. \nIn case more detailed inverter data is acquired, the  \nfollowing parameters provide useful information: \n\u2022 Inverter alarms. \n\u2022 Inverter temperature: This can give an indication of \nan upcoming problem or clogged ventilation holes. \nWhen monitoring large portfolios of solar PV  \ninstallations, the following challenges can occur: \n\u2022 High volumes of different installations with very \ndifferent characteristics. \n\u2022 Base parameters (Wp, orientation, tilt) are often \nincorrect or missing in the monitoring database. \n\u2022 Shading effects (trees, chimneys, etc.) which are \nseason dependent resulting in errors in yield \nanalysis. \n\u2022 Local irradiation measurement is too expensive \n\u2022 Errors in yield analysis due to clipping effects \nThe following best practices should be adopted: \n\u2022 Apply robust procedures during installation to \nstart from correct parameters. Installer \ntechnicians need to provide the correct \ninformation as part of the commissioning process. \n\u2022 Avoid a high variety of data acquisition methods \nand monitoring systems. \n\u2022 Apply performance index calculations that are \nimmune from the effects of shading (e.g., part of \nthe day, clear sky index). \n\u2022 Compare with a pool of nearby installations to \nneutralise temperature, wind, and pollution \neffects on performance indexes \n \n13.2.2. Maintenance \nThe Installer should not state that solar systems are  \nself-cleaning and do not require any maintenance. As \nbest practice, the Installer should educate their clients \nabout the necessity and benefits of a regular, high-\nquality O&M practice for the lifetime of their solar",

This should include a minimum yearly  \ninspection, and cleaning and maintenance based on  \nthe environmental conditions. This will ensure the  \ncontinuous safe operation of the asset and minimise \nH&S risks to building users. It will also maximise the  \nenergy production capability of their asset throughout \nits lifetime.  \nPreventive Maintenance of large residential portfolios \nis often limited to cleaning as part of a maintenance  \ncontract. Cleaning should be condition-based, rather  \nthan conform to a regular schedule. This can be  \ncombined with visual inspection of the cabling and  \ncleaning of inverter ventilators. \nIt needs to be clarified to homeowners or tenants that \nthey should not clean the panels themselves using  \nhigh pressure systems. This would void the warranty. \nIn areas with a high density of residential solar PV  \ninstallations, collective drone inspection should be  \nconsidered. In a short period, thermographic data of  \nlots of installations can be collected. \nCorrective Maintenance of large residential portfolios \nrelies heavily on a good monitoring system. Besides  \ndetecting and communicating alarms it should be able \nto detect decreasing performance trends. \nOnce an anomaly is detected, a trade-off will be made \nbetween speed of intervention and financial loss.  \nOften it is cheaper to group interventions in a certain  \ngeographical area. A limiting factor is also the access  \nto the house. Appointments must be made with the  \noccupants, which can take time. \nTo avoid the cost of sending an intervention team on-\nsite, tenants are often requested to perform certain  \nactions such as removing dust from ventilators and  \nresetting an installation (switch off/on). O&M service \nproviders should propose training for these tasks. \nMore advanced residential monitoring systems  \ncalculate trends in decreasing performance and  \nincreasing inverter temperature. Both parameters  \npredict an upcoming failure.",
